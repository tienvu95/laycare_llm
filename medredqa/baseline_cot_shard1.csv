25331,It is not safe for the patient to consume LSD while pregnant. The potential risks to the fetus outweigh any potential benefits. The patient should be advised to avoid using LSD and other substances during pregnancy.,"Thought 3: The patient is considering consuming LSD to overcome her attachment to nicotine. However, LSD is not a proven treatment for nicotine addiction, and its use during pregnancy is not recommended.
Action 3: Finish[The patient should be advised to explore evidence","So we don’t actually know if there is a safe level of alcohol for pregnant mothers to drink. We know alcohol causes birth defects, we also know that sometimes women who drink a little (think a glass of wine or a sip of champagne) before they know they are pregnant have OK outcomes- we don’t know what the limit is, if there is a limit (ie, is every fetus different?) etc. so we say no drinking, because the risk (FAS) is definitely there no matter what stage or how much you drink. It is not safe to drink alcohol while pregnant because we don’t know if there is a safe amount or what that safe amount is and it’s unethical to experiment. 

As for LSD... in rats it can cause miscarriage, and it has been shown to reduce blood flow in the placenta. It also sticks around in the placenta, which is a risk for mom, because placentas can and sometimes are tested for illegal substances after birth, which can be used to report mom to CPS. There are limited old studies showing eye damage to the fetus when mom takes LSD. It also has a statistically significant chance of causing chromosome damage to the fetus, which is a grab bag of effects. There is also a chance it does nothing. Some moms have done LSD before they knew or while they were pregnant and had normal babies. 

Ultimately, like alcohol, we know it can cause problems, but there isn’t a way to know where the line can be drawn. If you were sitting in my clinic, I’d say if you took LSD before you knew, wait to panic. If you’re considering taking it now, I’d advise you not to, since the effects in rats can be bad and again... we don’t know the line in the sand. So better safe than sorry. 

This is unfortunately the answer for a lot of things in pregnancy!

Thought 2: The patient is looking for a specific answer regarding the effects of LSD on a 1st trimester baby in her body.

Action 2: Finish[The patient should be advised that the effects of LSD on fetal development are not well understood and that consuming LSD during pregnancy is not recommended. The patient should be encouraged to discuss her concerns with her healthcare provider.]

Thought 3: The patient is considering consuming LSD to overcome her attachment to nicotine. However, LSD is not a proven treatment for nicotine addiction, and its use during pregnancy is not recommended.
Action 3: Finish[The patient should be advised to explore evidence","So we don’t actually know if there is a safe level of alcohol for pregnant mothers to drink. We know alcohol causes birth defects, we also know that sometimes women who drink a little (think a glass of wine or a sip of champagne) before they know they are pregnant have OK outcomes- we don’t know what the limit is, if there is a limit (ie, is every fetus different?) etc. so we say no drinking, because the risk (FAS) is definitely there no matter what stage or how much you drink. It is not safe to drink alcohol while pregnant because we don’t know if there is a safe amount or what that safe amount is and it’s unethical to experiment. As for LSD... in rats it can cause miscarriage, and it has been shown to reduce blood flow in the placenta. It also sticks around in the placenta, which is a risk for mom, because placentas can and sometimes are tested for illegal substances after birth, which can be used to report mom to CPS. There are limited old studies showing eye damage to the fetus when mom takes LSD. It also has a statistically significant chance of causing chromosome damage to the fetus, which is a grab bag of effects. There is also a chance it does nothing. Some moms have done LSD before they knew or while they were pregnant and had normal babies. Ultimately, like alcohol, we know it can cause problems, but there isn’t a way to know where the line can be drawn. If you were sitting in my clinic, I’d say if you took LSD before you knew, wait to panic. If you’re considering taking it now, I’d advise you not to, since the effects in rats can be bad and again... we don’t know the line in the sand. So better safe than sorry. This is unfortunately the answer for a lot of things in pregnancy! And no judgement. I used to work harm reduction and needle exchange/outreach. I get it- life is complicated, your story is complicated, and there isn’t any good to come from a “DRUGS BAD” or “DRUGS GOOD” position.","Thought 3: The patient is considering consuming LSD to overcome her attachment to nicotine.

Action: Finish","I'm in Canada, but most child protection laws are similar around the world. If a doc from Ireland comments, their advice may be more relevant for you; although hopefully I can help.

As you mentioned, you're an adult now. Under the law, adults are able to determine for themselves what the right course of action is. Mandatory reporting exists for children because they are powerless in a situation, and at times cannot speak for themselves. But as an adult now, you would fall outside the mandatory reporting laws and outside the child protection system. Your doctor must keep your confidentiality above all else, and cannot go report to the police or child protection on your behalf without your permission in cases of past trauma.

And it sounds like this situation was in the past, so there would be no grounds for your doctor to break confidentiality. Even if it was ongoing, as an adult, it's your choice what to do about the situation. As an example, there are lots of adults who experience domestic violence at home. And while we worry about our patients and their safety, that's their choice and we can't override confidentiality to talk to the police. That's wrong for a number of reasons. So we support them and try to mitigate risk in the interim.

All this to say, you should 100% be able to bring up these concerns with your doctor. You can start the conversation and simply say, ""What is your policy on confidentiality and mandatory reporting?"" (adding, if you like, ""I have some trauma in my past that is hard to talk about"" or something to that effect if you feel safe to do so). Ideally this way, your doc can go over local rules and then you can disclose what you choose, in a timeline you choose, and in the detail you choose. You're in control this way.

I think you're past the point that child protection would have to be involved, and past the point of mandatory reporting for previously experienced trauma. You should never, ever, have to speak your assaulter's name if you do not want to. This is your story, your life - not theirs.

So if you feel safe to do so, definitely make an appointment with your doctor to go over this stuff. Like most humans, not all docs are trauma-informed, so if you do find that talking to this doctor isn't the right person to talk about this with, ask for a referral to a specialist who has experience with adverse childhood experiences / child trauma.

Action 2: Further investigation into the patient's dental history, including a review of their X-rays and a consultation with an orthodontist, may be necessary to determine if the patient's wisdom teeth are indeed contributing to their TMJ issues.","I’m a dentist and I would advise going to a dental school (or some sort of facility with dental research, but generally dental schools are your best bet) and seeing an orofacial pain/TMD specialist. TMD stands for temporomandibular disorder, the term for TMJ disorders. There are not that many out there, and it is not a recognized dental specialty, but I know of one at a dental school where the dentist solely focuses on people with horrible pain related to the TMJ and face and works with a physical therapist to help alleviate the issues. The one I’m familiar with prescribes a lot of muscle relaxants and uses massage and home therapy. 

I don’t think TMD can always be treated by orthotic devices or braces, either. It depends on the case, but I would be worried about there being any actual degradation within the TMJs on either side. I assume you’ve had some sort of panoramic radiograph or even hopefully a cone beam CT scan to monitor your joints!

The popping in the TMJ is not always an issue in and of itself, but it has to do with the joint’s rotation and glide motion having some interference to get back to the resting position.

The way that I learned it, the spaces you have between your top and bottom teeth really COULD be a sign that there is degradation of your joint. If you think about it, if the hinge that connects your maxilla (top) and mandible changes, then your teeth are unable to come together the same way. Based on your symptoms, it sounds like the joint problem is causing the tooth problem, and moving the teeth around (braces) is not going to address the fact that the joint is breaking down. It is more likely that than the braces causing the posterior space, but I could be wrong. It sounds like a lot of different treatments have been attempted so far. 

I really hope you’re able to find an orofacial pain/TMD specialist!!! I think you really need someone who is familiar with joint degradation to help you out more fully, and this is a case that I personally as a general dentist would not be able to treat alone.

Regarding your question:
- Unfortunately liver function tests don't measure liver function well. The tests that make up the ""liver function test"" panel provide information about damage to liver cells. The liver has quite a lot of reserve capacity built in, and because of the livers reserve there can be a lot of liver damage before the tests move out of the normal range.

[This paper]( is a few years old, but I'm not sure there's anything more recent that specifically adresses (isolated) adenomyosis and deep dyspareunia:

> Endometriosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, and interstitial cystitis have been associated with deep dyspareunia. Although medical therapies may improve deep dyspareunia in women with endometriosis, laparoscopic excision of deep endometriotic lesions has been demonstrated to improve not only deep dyspareunia but also the quality of sex life. Deep dyspareunia related to the presence of pelvic congestion syndrome should be treated by pelvic vein embolization. Intravesical therapy may be effective in treating deep dyspareunia in women with interstitial cystitis.
