My reasoning was incomplete because I did not consider the possibility of a more serious underlying condition, such as hypomyelination or leukodystrophy, which could be causing the white matter hyperintensities.

However, I also should have considered the fact that the patient has seen multiple doctors without any testing being performed, which raises concerns about the comprehensive nature of their care. Next time, I will take a more nuanced approach and consider both the positive and negative aspects of the situation.

My reasoning was correct in identifying the potential motivations behind the doctor's decision, but it may have been incomplete in not considering other possible explanations for the doctor's actions. For example, the doctor may have genuinely believed that the patient required additional treatment, or there may have been a miscommunication or misunderstanding among the medical team. Additionally, my answer may have been overly simplistic in attributing the doctor's decision solely to financial gain or a desire to extend the treatment period.

Briefly explain why your reasoning or answer may have been wrong or incomplete.
My reasoning was incomplete because I didn't consider the patient's age and the fact that they are experiencing palpitations almost every day.

My previous answer was correct in that the patient's lab results are normal, but I may have been too quick to dismiss the possibility of an underlying medical condition.

They have tried various treatments, including braces, physical therapy, deep tissue massage, upper cervical care, orthotic devices, and arthroscopy TMJ surgery, but none have provided lasting relief.","I’m a dentist and I would advise going to a dental school (or some sort of facility with dental research, but generally dental schools are your best bet) and seeing an orofacial pain/TMD specialist. TMD stands for temporomandibular disorder, the term for TMJ disorders. There are not that many out there, and it is not a recognized dental specialty, but I know of one at a dental school where the dentist solely focuses on people with horrible pain related to the TMJ and face and works with a physical therapist to help alleviate the issues. The one I’m familiar with prescribes a lot of muscle relaxants and uses massage and home therapy. 

I don’t think TMD can always be treated by orthotic devices or braces, either. It depends on the case, but I would be worried about there being any actual degradation within the TMJs on either side. I assume you’ve had some sort of panoramic radiograph or even hopefully a cone beam CT scan to monitor your joints!

The popping in the TMJ is not always an issue in and of itself, but it has to do with the joint’s rotation and glide motion having some interference to get back to the resting position.

The way that I learned it, the spaces you have between your top and bottom teeth really COULD be a sign that there is degradation of your joint. If you think about it, if the hinge that connects your maxilla (top) and mandible changes, then your teeth are unable to come together the same way. Based on your symptoms, it sounds like the joint problem is causing the tooth problem, and moving the teeth around (braces) is not going to address the fact that the joint is breaking down. It is more likely that than the braces causing the posterior space, but I could be wrong. It sounds like a lot of different treatments have been attempted so far. 

I really hope you’re able to find an orofacial pain/TMD specialist!!! I think you really need someone who is familiar with joint degradation to help you out more fully, and this is a case that I personally as a general dentist would not be able to treat alone.

Edit: Also, going to a sleep specialist and having a sleep study done is not a bad idea either!

The idea of the test is to see how your glucose levels change over a 2 hour period

The problem I have with this is how do they reference a normal range when no one person consumes the same amount of sugar?

My answer was correct in the sense that it acknowledged the possibility of transmission through hand-to-mouth contact, but it may have been overly simplistic and lacked nuance.

The patient should also be educated about the risks and benefits of vaccination, and the importance of herd immunity. A compromise could be to start with a single vaccine and monitor her daughter's reaction before proceeding with further vaccinations. The patient should also be encouraged to discuss her fears and concerns with her healthcare provider, and to work together to find a solution that works for her and her daughter.",The patient has a history of autoimmune issues and adverse reactions to certain medications and vaccines. She is concerned about her daughter's potential for autoimmune issues and wants to protect her.,"I always tell vaccine-hesitant parents some version of this:

I have multiple young children myself.  Most of my colleagues, other pediatric specialists, also have kids.  All of us, like nearly 100%, vaccinate our children according to the CDC schedule.  So, the people that are most informed about vaccines are absolutely adamant about their own children (who they, admittedly, love a whole lot more than their patients) getting vaccinated.  

This could only happen in three situations:

1. We get so much $$$ from big pharma that we don't mind putting our own children at risk.
2. Doctors are so universally brainwashed that they don't mind putting their own children at risk.  
3. This group of people is very much aware of the importance of vaccination, both for their children, and for society, and do so out of thoughtful consideration of the risks and benefits, concluding that the benefits massively outweigh the risks.  

I'm going with #3 as the only one that makes sense.


Edit:

I’ll also add that many doctors make the mistake of piling on more scientific information to convince a vaccine hesitant parent.  Not only does it not work, it actually causes further entrenchment in fear of vaccines.  Appeals to emotion are far more effective (even though we as doctors instinctively see these as being somewhat manipulative):  “Aren’t you worried about your child getting a scary disease?”   “Don’t you want to do your part to protect vulnerable children that can’t be vaccinated?”",False,False,0.9,,4,3,"1.

I work in the microbiology lab. I tell your doctors what the bacteria (or other) we find so that they can treat more effectively. 

I don’t know a lot about the clinical side, but I can tell you that normally respiratory samples we get are usually sputum or a lavage (they “wash” the lung and send us the fluid that is washed out). Normally these samples are sufficient to diagnose a cause of pneumonia. 

The problem is that bacteria are very good at hiding. If they are not on the surfaces of the lung or if they form a barrier to protect themselves (biofilm, abscess), then it may be much harder to recover the bacteria on a lavage. In those cases it may be necessary also to take a piece of the lung itself so we can grind the tissue and try to release the bacteria to grow it so we can get some answers. 

Of course, they could be doing the surgery to remove the infection before it can spread. There are also things other than bacteria that can cause pneumonia that will not appear on a culture unless specifically requested (mold, mycobacterium such as tuberculosis, viruses).

[This paper]( is a few years old, but I'm not sure there's anything more recent that specifically adresses (isolated) adenomyosis and deep dyspareunia:

> Endometriosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, and interstitial cystitis have been associated with deep dyspareunia. Although medical therapies may improve deep dyspareunia in women with endometriosis, laparoscopic excision of deep endometriotic lesions has been demonstrated to improve not only deep dyspareunia but also the quality of sex life. Deep dyspareunia related to the presence of pelvic congestion syndrome should be treated by pelvic vein embolization. Intravesical therapy may be effective in treating deep dyspareunia in women with interstitial cystitis. It remains unclear **whether** uterine myomas and **adenomyosis are causes of deep dyspareunia**.

My reasoning was correct in that I considered the patient's symptoms and medical history, but I may have been too quick to dismiss the possibility of a heart condition.

The usual progression for this kind of dry gangrene would be autoamputation, where the affected tissue (in this case, his third toe) would eventually, quite literally, fall off painlessly.
