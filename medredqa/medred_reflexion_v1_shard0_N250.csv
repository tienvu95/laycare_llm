But dieticians do. The basic advice is to eat at a caloric deficit. That’s all it takes to lose weight. It is “simple” but not easy. A dietician can help you with ideas to make that a reality. They can look at your food diary and look for high calorie/low nutrient foods that you can reduce, and suggest high nutrient/low calorie foods to take their place. They can help you develop meal plans too. Most doctors would advise diet modifications and safe increases in activity as first line treatment for obesity. It’s the safest and most effective way. They are unlikely to prescribe medications or suggest surgery unless those lifestyle changes fail In the meantime, you can start counting your calories. Keeping a food diary is a great start!

This comment is for general information purposes only, and not intended to provide medical advice. No physician-patient relationship is implied or established._ As you already know as the brother of someone with sickle cell disease, SSD causes tremendous suffering. Not only are there acute painful crises, but there is often the development of chronic pain, damage to the internal organs, permanent disability, and the side effects of medications (especially of long-term opioid pain medicine use). A brief primer: SSD is a conduit where your hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying protein) inside your red blood cells has a mistake in it. This mistake allows the hemoglobin to form chains by linking up. Ordinarily, the millions of hemoglobin proteins do not link up at all. When they do, the chains cause your red blood cells to change shape from roundish to more like a bent stick - a ""sickle"" shape. Because they are not round they can clog up the small blood vessels (capillaries) like a logjam. Lack of blood flow produces pain and other problems. So when people with SSD have severe recurrent crises, or other specific severe problems, sometimes an exchange transfusion is used. This is exactly what it sounds like: they exchange the patients blood for someone else's blood. They removed the blood that can sickle, and replace it with blood that cannot. This temporarily.improves the situation, but blood cells eventually die, and the patient's body produces more (sickle) blood. > Are these safe? As safe as any blood transfusion. Pretty safe, although there are risks.

It often takes time for this to settle down, even after the infection itself has resolved. Anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen) and paracetamol are appropriate treatments in the meantime. If your pain starts to worsen rather than improving, you should see a doctor.

2059,"I’m an adult neurologist (resident). Ditto /u/sapphireminds ‘s succinct explanation as to what the drug does, and I’ll add further. This special type of diuretic helps decrease the pressure in your head. The goal of this is to thereby improve symptoms like headache, visual issues etc as well as reduce the swelling of your optic nerves (I imagine you had someone look in the back of your eyes, which usually shows papilledema aka optic nerve head/disc swelling in IIH patients) to prevent further or worsened damage to your vision. I don’t want to frighten you, but I did want to be clear in case the other neuro wasn’t about something critical to know about IIH. Not addressing this with weight loss and medication can potentially lead to continued damage to your optic nerves, possibly leading to long standing or even permanent vision disturbances/loss. With lifestyle changes and modest weight loss, many patients can be tapered down or even completely weaned off the medication. Most likely this wouldn’t be for at least several months to a year from diagnosis and treatment initiation. There are other drugs that can be added, doses adjusted, etc while working on weight loss if symptoms or papilledema worsen in spite of treatment. So basically, I can’t predict if you will or will not need acetazolamide for future long term use. It depends in part to how your body responds to the drug and following up with your neurologist if inadequately treated after a few weeks, to ensure optimal medical therapy for you. Ultimately weight loss is the most effective and potentially curative treatment for IIH. Much easier said than done, but it is important to try your best at losing weight, stay the course and not get discouraged since this condition takes awhile to improve, and take your medication as prescribed. And of course, don’t hesitate to look for another neurologist if the one who you initially saw didn’t click well with you.","Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, thereby lowering intracranial pressure.

42073,"I can help decipher some of this. First off, you should know that cancers are assessed by STAGE and GRADE. - **Grade** indicates how similar to normal tissue they appear visually: high grade is dissimilar to normal tissue; low grade is similar to normal tissue - **Stage** indicates the spread of a tumor: high stage cancer has metastasized; low stage cancer is localized Unfortunately, I'm not as familiar with the prognosis of lymphomas as I should be, so I can't offer much insight there. The rest of the report describes what markers the cancer cells had or didn't have. Here's what each of them mean: - **CD20** just indicates its a B-Cell lymphoma (a specific type of lymphocyte) - **Ki67** is an indicates of cell proliferation. Basically, it measures how rapidly the cancer cells are growing. Leukemia and lymphoma both tend to have much higher Ki-67 readings than other cancers. While a high Ki67 reading does indicate a high rate of growth, it also means that those cells are *very* susceptible to chemotherapy. So assuming you're able to begin therapy promptly, a high Ki-67 is actually probably a good thing. - **Bcl-2** is a marker for a particular type of lymphoma called Follicular Lymphoma. Yours was Bcl-2 negative, and is therefore *not* follicular lymphoma - **CD-3 and CD-5** are just T-Cell markers (another specific type of lymphocyte). In this case, I believe the report is referencing non-cancer cells with these markers. - **Cyclin D-1** is the marker for another type of lymphoma called Mantle Cell lymphoma. Again, yours was negative, and is therefore *not* Mantle Cell lymphoma. The other markers I'm not very familiar with. I hope this helps.","The patient should undergo further investigation and treatment as soon as possible, ideally within a shorter timeframe than two months, to determine the best course of action for their high-grade B-cell lymphoma.",False,0.9,0.099378884,,,,

14240,"Is there a limit to immune system ""memory""? - Nope. Your immune system is in contact with 100s to 1000s of things daily (from your skin, your gut, your kids, the air, etc.) and has space to categorize all those on a harmful-harmless scale. Sometimes it gets stuff wrong (see: allergies), sometimes it gets too excited (see: autoimmune), sometimes it forgets what it learned prior. But it can always learn new things, even if it slows down on how well it learns those. How many different things can someone be vaccinated for? - There's no real top limit here. Again, your immune system encounters exponentially more out in the world than it does through vaccines. We decide what to vaccinate for based on what's available, what's common/contagious enough, and prior evidence of when individual protection wears thin. But there are more bacterial cells on/in your body than there are human cells. Your immune system has plenty of space. :) Do the older vaccinations wear off as new vaccinations are received, or do they fade away by age or something else? - Older vaccinations of some subtypes can ""wear off"" or separately become less effective, but this is more a product of the type of vaccine and the disease agent itself, not the immune system filling up. For instance, most people never need MMR again after a 2-shot series (some even have full immunity after 1 shot), same for HiB vaccines and polio. However, we know the tetanus and pertussis components of the Tdap/DTap vaccine do wane over time, lasting 5-10 years each, so we booster that pretty regularly in adults. Other vaccines covered a previous variant of the illness but not the current circulating one (see: flu), so we give a new one to help train the immune system on the new one. What fades and why is complicated and has some to do with what specific parts we are vaccinating for (i.e., for tetanus and pertussis it's actually a toxoid vaccine, where we train the immune system to recognize the bacterial product and not the bacteria itself) as well as other things above my paygrade. Can an immune system get ""full"" like computer memory? IE If I get a flu shot does the Hepatitis vaccine from years ago get forgotten or does everything just keep adding on to ""things I have an immunity to""? - No, the immune system doesn't get full. It can forget things for a variety of reasons, or it can fail to respond to a vaccine in the first place (one the reasons some of the childhood shots are series is that a certain percentage of people have immunity after one shot while a larger group is fully protected after 2). These are all kind of variations on a theme, so just to repeat the theme - your immune system encounters an incredible number of pathogens a day, no matter how spotless you keep yourself and your house. Your immune system is far, far more challenged by those than any number of vaccinations we could potentially give you. It literally evolved just for that purpose, in a world where there were even more parasites, bacteria, viruses and the like.","There is no limit to the number of vaccinations that can be effective, but the effectiveness of older vaccinations can decline over time due to waning immunity or the presence of other health conditions.",False,0.8,0.09756097,,,,

They write small, which is better than large, I interpret as possible 1-2 cm in diameter. The brain tissue in that area will essentially be gone forever. So there is a chance that some of her symptoms won't go away. Often though, in the outer parts of the injured area, the nerve cells don't permanently die, but are temporarily numbed. Many patients who've had strokes will become a bit better, but it's impossible to say just how much better she'll be. It's also concerning that you say she gets worse by day, because it is possible to get additional strokes.","The patient's condition is serious and requires immediate medical attention. The extent of the brain damage is difficult to determine without a detailed analysis of the MRI report, but it appears to be significant.",False,,0.18367347,,,,

Check to see if your testosterone is actually low for your age—then it’s a personal decision between you and your doctor what is right for you if it does turn out to be. I would note that almost everything you’re mentioning is also a symptom of the dreaded (and ultimately fatal) disease called “aging.” Most men in their late 20s don’t have as high a sex drive as they used to, might gain a little weight, and might even start to lose hair.

You should see a physician about having a barium swallow done in outpatient radiology, this is a fluoroscopic procedure that looks at your swallowing process and observes whether or not you have reflux when positioned in both upright, prone, supine, and decubitus (sideways) positions. Or they may opt to do an upper endoscopy.","The patient should consider lifestyle changes and stress management techniques, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and relaxation techniques like meditation or deep breathing, to help manage their symptoms.

44642,"Hello! Registered nurse here. There are a great many factors that can cause slower wound healing, ranging from the mild (aging) to the moderate (diabetes) to the extreme (cancer). Seeing as you mentioned no other symptoms, it’s probably due to something not quite so drastic as cancer, haha, such as... Aging Stress Some drugs (i.e. steroids, long-term NSAID use) Alcohol Smoking Nutritional deficiencies Because you asked, some nutritional deficiencies (including, but not limited to, proteins, amino acids, vitamin C, zinc, etc) can indeed cause slower wound healing. If you’re truly concerned, you should see your HCP and discuss your worries with them. A blood test can investigate whether or not a nutritional issue is possibly the cause. As a vegetarian, you should probably get one anyway if you haven’t in the past, if only because you’re at a greater risk for nutritional deficiencies (unless you’re taking vitamin/mineral supplements, I suppose). I also suggest reading [this article]( It goes over slowed wound healing and the myriad causes of it. Side note: If your wounds are taking extra time to heal, please take care to protect them from infection! Slap some antibiotics on that sucker. Good luck!!","The patient is concerned about slower wound healing and scarring. He has noticed this issue in recent years, particularly with minor wounds such as scratches from cats and dogs.

This comment is for general information purposes only, and not intended to provide medical advice. No physician-patient relationship is implied or established._ > i think i might have a kidney infection but the ER docs only blow me off From the details in this vignette, the patient has had two complete emergency room evaluations. It does not appear that anyone is being ""blown off"". In the emergency department, the emergency physician is looking mainly for medical emergencies and for acute medical conditions that require immediate intervention. If the emergency physician doesn't find a clear diagnosis, and the condition does not require hospitalization, then the next step is to follow up with a doctor as an outpatient. Usually, this would be the patient's primary care provider, but might also include a specialist (especially if a specific medical condition was proven or suspected). Without interviewing and examining the patient, and reviewing the available records, it is impossible to make a diagnosis or speculate as to a treatment plan.","The patient should be referred to a specialist, such as a nephrologist, for further evaluation and treatment. The ER doctors' dismissal of a kidney infection and suggestion of cannabis hyperemesis may be incorrect, and a specialist can provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",False,,0.23387097,,,,

I do want to take the time to express how truly sorry I am that you are going through what you are. The cliche that is all too true is this too shall pass - you will best this one way or the other, especially so given your displayed mental fortitude. You sound to be well taken care of physically in terms of your support system; however, I want to enforce how imperative mental health is to your holistic wellbeing. Seek the care of therapy or psychiatry (if you haven't) in order to gain healthy coping mechanisms and rule out biochemical stressors that make this ordeal even worse.
