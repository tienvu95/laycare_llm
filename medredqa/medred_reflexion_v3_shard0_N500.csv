My previous answer was correct in identifying potential underlying conditions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms, but it may have been incomplete in not fully exploring the patient's medical history and potential allergies. The patient's history of anaphylaxis-like reactions and allergies to milk, cats, dogs, and dust mites suggests that she may have a mast cell disorder or other conditions that could be contributing to her gastrointestinal symptoms. However, I may have overlooked the potential connection between her allergies and her gastrointestinal symptoms.

2059,"The patient should be on Acetazolamide until her intracranial pressure is well-controlled, and then the decision to continue or taper the medication should be made on a case-by-case basis.","Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, thereby lowering intracranial pressure. It can be used as a first-line treatment for IIH, but its long-term efficacy and safety are still being studied. The decision to continue or taper the medication should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's individual response and the presence of any potential side effects.",Please provide your answer,"Thought 2: The patient is also concerned about the neurologist's bedside manner and feels uncomfortable asking questions. I should acknowledge her concerns and provide reassurance about the safety and efficacy of the medication, as well as offer guidance on how to communicate with healthcare providers to address concerns and determine the best course of treatment.

Ditto /u/sapphireminds ‘s succinct explanation as to what the drug does, and I’ll add further. This special type of diuretic helps decrease the pressure in your head. The goal of this is to thereby improve symptoms like headache, visual issues etc as well as reduce the swelling of your optic nerves (I imagine you had someone look in the back of your eyes, which usually shows papilledema aka optic nerve head/disc swelling in IIH patients) to prevent further or worsened damage to your vision. 

I don’t want to frighten you, but I did want to be clear in case the other neuro wasn’t about something critical to know about IIH. Not addressing this with weight loss and medication can potentially lead to continued damage to your optic nerves, possibly leading to long standing or even permanent vision disturbances/loss. 

With lifestyle changes and modest weight loss, many patients can be tapered down or even completely weaned off the medication. Most likely this wouldn’t be for at least several months to a year from diagnosis and treatment initiation. There are other drugs that can be added, doses adjusted, etc while working on weight loss if symptoms or papilledema worsen in spite of treatment. 

So basically, I can’t predict if you will or will not need acetazolamide for future long term use. It depends in part to how your body responds to the drug and following up with your neurologist if inadequately treated after a few weeks, to ensure optimal medical therapy for you. Ultimately weight loss is the most effective and potentially curative treatment for IIH. Much easier said than done, but it is important to try your best at losing weight, stay the course and not get discouraged since this condition takes awhile to improve, and take your medication as prescribed.

Doctors learn so much, but unfortunately nutrition and diet information isn’t something they learn in depth. But dieticians do.

The basic advice is to eat at a caloric deficit. That’s all it takes to lose weight. It is “simple” but not easy.

A dietician can help you with ideas to make that a reality. They can look at your food diary and look for high calorie/low nutrient foods that you can reduce, and suggest high nutrient/low calorie foods to take their place. They can help you develop meal plans too.

Most doctors would advise diet modifications and safe increases in activity as first line treatment for obesity. It’s the safest and most effective way. They are unlikely to prescribe medications or suggest surgery unless those lifestyle changes fail

In the meantime, you can start counting your calories. Keeping a food diary is a great start! The next step is to weigh/measure those foods and enter them into a calorie counter (MyFitnessPal is probably the most popular and is really easy to use) to see how much you are actually eating in a day.

- **Grade** indicates how similar to normal tissue they appear visually: high grade is dissimilar to normal tissue; low grade is similar to normal tissue

- **Stage** indicates the spread of a tumor: high stage cancer has metastasized; low stage cancer is localized

Unfortunately, I'm not as familiar with the prognosis of lymphomas as I should be, so I can't offer much insight there. The rest of the report describes what markers the cancer cells had or didn't have. Here's what each of them mean:

- **CD20** just indicates its a B-Cell lymphoma (a specific type of lymphocyte)
- **Ki67** is an indicates of cell proliferation. Basically, it measures how rapidly the cancer cells are growing. Leukemia and lymphoma both tend to have much higher Ki-67 readings than other cancers. While a high Ki67 reading does indicate a high rate of growth, it also means that those cells are *very* susceptible to chemotherapy. So assuming you're able to begin therapy promptly, a high Ki-67 is actually probably a good thing.

- **Bcl-2** is a marker for a particular type of lymphoma called Follicular Lymphoma. Yours was Bcl-2 negative, and is therefore *not* follicular lymphoma

- **CD-3 and CD-5** are just T-Cell markers (another specific type of lymphocyte). In this case, I believe the report is referencing non-cancer cells with these markers.

As you already know as the brother of someone with sickle cell disease, SSD causes tremendous suffering. Not only are there acute painful crises, but there is often the development of chronic pain, damage to the internal organs, permanent disability, and the side effects of medications (especially of long-term opioid pain medicine use).

A brief primer:

SSD is a conduit where your hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying protein) inside your red blood cells has a mistake in it. This mistake allows the hemoglobin to form chains by linking up. Ordinarily, the millions of hemoglobin proteins do not link up at all. When they do, the chains cause your red blood cells to change shape from roundish to more like a bent stick - a ""sickle"" shape. Because they are not round they can clog up the small blood vessels (capillaries) like a logjam. Lack of blood flow produces pain and other problems.

So when people with SSD have severe recurrent crises, or other specific severe problems, sometimes an exchange transfusion is used. This is exactly what it sounds like: they exchange the patients blood for someone else's blood. They removed the blood that can sickle, and replace it with blood that cannot.

This temporarily.improves the situation, but blood cells eventually die, and the patient's body produces more (sickle) blood.

> Are these safe?

As safe as any blood transfusion. Pretty safe, although there are risks. A large IV catheter is needed, and this can cause problems people who have recurrent transfusions can develop problems.

>  Will he be okay for a while after this? 

Usually, after an exchange transfusion, the patient will be free of painful crises for a few months.


> It’s pretty terrifying going through this.

The patient has also tried ear drops without improvement, which suggests that the issue may not be just earwax buildup.",(Note: Please make,"Thought 3: The patient's age and the fact that they are a young adult might suggest a different set of possible causes for their symptoms. The patient's symptoms are not severe, and they have tried ear drops without improvement",0.8,,"The concern at this point is if you have a condition called sudden sensorineural hearing loss. This is considered one of the few things from an ear standpoint that should be seen sooner than later. The reason being, the treatment for this condition is high dose steroids that ideally are started within 2 weeks of symptom onset. Currently, you're getting pretty close to that point. It requires a hearing test to evaluate (or at least a good examination with something called a tuning fork). Even with steroids, there is a chance the hearing would not come back, but there is some literature saying the chances of it coming back are higher if you take the steroids.

The unfortunate aspect of this is that this muffled hearing also can present similarly to hearing that is muffled because of earwax or Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). If you are able to pop your ears and the hearing returns, ETD is more likely. If the hearing is down and staying down throughout the day (it may slowly improve from day to day, but should be relatively constant) it is more consistent with sensorineural hearing loss.

At this point, I would recommend seeing someone first thing in the morning for evaluation, whether that be your primary care provider or if they are unable to fit you in, an emergency room.

I know that the immune system can remember a large number of vaccinations, but the concept of ""full"" immune system memory is not well understood. It is possible that the immune system can handle a large number of vaccinations, but the effectiveness of each vaccination may decline over time","Please provide your answer in the format: Finish[answer]
(Then on a new line, write 'Confidence: p' where p is a number",,0.8,"Is there a limit to immune system ""memory""?

 - Nope. Your immune system is in contact with 100s to 1000s of things daily (from your skin, your gut, your kids, the air, etc.) and has space to categorize all those on a harmful-harmless scale. Sometimes it gets stuff wrong (see: allergies), sometimes it gets too excited (see: autoimmune), sometimes it forgets what it learned prior. But it can always learn new things, even if it slows down on how well it learns those.

How many different things can someone be vaccinated for?

 - There's no real top limit here. Again, your immune system encounters exponentially more out in the world than it does through vaccines. We decide what to vaccinate for based on what's available, what's common/contagious enough, and prior evidence of when individual protection wears thin. But there are more bacterial cells on/in your body than there are human cells. Your immune system has plenty of space. :)

Do the older vaccinations wear off as new vaccinations are received, or do they fade away by age or something else?

 - Older vaccinations of some subtypes can ""wear off"" or separately become less effective, but this is more a product of the type of vaccine and the disease agent itself, not the immune system filling up. For instance, most people never need MMR again after a 2-shot series (some even have full immunity after 1 shot), same for HiB vaccines and polio. However, we know the tetanus and pertussis components of the Tdap/DTap vaccine do wane over time, lasting 5-10 years each, so we booster that pretty regularly in adults. Other vaccines covered a previous variant of the illness but not the current circulating one (see: flu), so we give a new one to help train the immune system on the new one. What fades and why is complicated and has some to do with what specific parts we are vaccinating for (i.e., for tetanus and pertussis it's actually a toxoid vaccine, where we train the immune system to recognize the bacterial product and not the bacteria itself) as well as other things above my paygrade.

Can an immune system get ""full"" like computer memory? IE If I get a flu shot does the Hepatitis vaccine from years ago get forgotten or does everything just keep adding on to ""things I have an immunity to""?

 - No, the immune system doesn't get full. It can forget things for a variety of reasons, or it can fail to respond to a vaccine in the first place (one the reasons some of the childhood shots are series is that a certain percentage of people have immunity after one shot while a larger group is fully protected after 2). 

These are all kind of variations on a theme, so just to repeat the theme - your immune system encounters an incredible number of pathogens a day, no matter how spotless you keep yourself and your house. Your immune system is far, far more challenged by those than any number of vaccinations we could potentially give you. It literally evolved just for that purpose, in a world where there were even more parasites, bacteria, viruses and the like.",False,False,4,3,"My answer was incorrect because I didn't provide a clear and concise explanation of the concept of immune system memory and its limitations.

Myocarditis can happen with any viral infection really. Severity can be from mild to severe, and some people can make a complete recovery, others could die or need a transplant or anywhere in between. 

Your alcoholism does need treatment, that's an unhealthy coping mechanism to a very frightening event. And of course the trauma of the event should be dealt with in therapy. 

It can be very traumatizing to have a serious health issue, especially one line that which comes out of nowhere. About eight years ago I had an idiosyncratic drug reaction and was potentially facing transplant or death, all because my liver was exposed to something and decided to try and yeet itself out of existence. 

Like you, I survived without any real lingering issues, and I've had therapy to deal with it, because it caused a lot of upheaval in my life, indirectly. 

Any time we feel out of control like that, it can be terrifying, and it sounds like you haven't been given the proper tools to help you cope with it. Ideally, you would have had therapy during/after. It's hard to be truly confronted with your own mortality, and I would guess it was even harder for you because you were so much younger than I was, and at an age when you really feel immortal, and to have that pulled away from you compounded everything. 

There's all sorts of reactions people can have to events like that, either self improvement or self destruction are common. It's an unconscious desire to at least be in control of what might kill you, or a survivor's type guilt that you didn't die and others in your place have.

They are just random chance.

I know that statins can reduce the risk of stroke, but they also have potential side effects, such as muscle pain and cognitive issues. The patient is concerned about these potential side effects and wants to avoid taking another pill.
Action: Finish[The patient should discuss their concerns with their doctor and consider alternative approaches to managing their risk of stroke, such as lifestyle changes and other medications that may have fewer side effects.]",0.8,0.8,"As my username implies, I would take a statin in this situation. 

There is ample evidence of the kind you are looking for - which compares people who took statins with people who didn't with regard to stroke prevention. I wouldn't bother reading abstracts of individual studies, the best place to go for something like this is a meta-analysis which summarizes all the research ever done on the topic. [This]( is a good example, a very comprehensive study commissioned by the US government to survey the role of statins in prevention. In one section, it says ""fatal or nonfatal stroke (13 trials; RR, 0.71 after 6 months to 6 years"", which means that there was an average 29% reduction in the incidence of stroke over the next 6 months to 6 years in the 13 trials which have been done on the topic. 

I understand your fear regarding side effects. This meta-analysis also discusses this issue in the paragraph ""Harms of Statin Treatment"". To summarize the relevant paragraph, statins are well tolerated and are not shown to cause any significant side effects, including muscle aches or cognitive issues. I understand there is a lot of bad press regarding statins with a lot of very vocal patient groups out there on the internet, but in the real world we see minimal issues with statins when used in very large numbers of our patients. 

If you are still concerned re side effects, a reasonable compromise is to take a low dose statin. There is a world of difference between 80mg of atorvastatin and 5mg of rosuvastatin in terms of risk of side effects, and the cholesterol lowering of 5mg of rosuvastatin is actually still quite good. For my patients who have concerns or bad experiences re the higher doses, I usually suggest 5mg of rosuvastatin and have never had a patient who had issues with this.

I am so sorry to hear that. Losing a parent at any age is hard, but I can imagine especially so as you transition between adolescence to young adulthood.

>when he will take PSA tests next time

For what it's worth, the recommendation behind routine PSA screening is controversial. The current United States Preventive Service Task Force recommendation is to leave the decision to screen up to the individual patient and his doctor. The reasoning is that there is a high rate of false positives, i.e. a cancer scare, that turns out to be negative. However, the workup for a cancer scare comes with the risk of complications and patients get harmed.

>Is there anything I can do to help him or recommend to him?

Yes, see an internal medicine, family medicine, or geriatric doctor (more info later) for an annual physical and ask what recommendations the doctors has to stay healthy. The rest of your post has a number of health myths or outdated medical advice that I will address.

>Maybe he should weight train and build muscle to reduce the chances of falling and breaking a bone \*knock on wood\*, maybe he should drink more water or should I buy him a face cream so that he can have a good barrier for his immune system?

Yes, regular weight-bearing exercises are good to help the elderly keep their muscle tone and prevent falls. Getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise (moderate pace walking, jogging, running, swimming bicycling, etc.) is also recommended to keep the heart healthy, keep blood pressure and cholesterol normal, and improve mood. As far as bone health goes, evidence for checking vitamin D and replacing vitamin D if low in otherwise healthy community-dwelling elderly adults to prevent falls is lacking. Unless he has another condition that increases his risk of bone fractures, he does not need any other tests, e.g. DEXA scan of his bones for osteoporosis.

Drinking a healthy amount of water is always a good idea; however,  it's hard to recommend how much water to drink and without knowing if your dad has an underlying diagnoses that would point him away from drinking too much water, i.e. chronic heart, lung, or liver disease. I will say that as people age, their thirst drive does diminish and the elderly have to be reminded to drink water or else they risk dehydration.

To my knowledge, there isn't evidence behind the benefits of face cream. Minimizing exposure to the sun, covering up skin,  regular use of sunscreen, and annual thorough skin exam (EVERY single centimeter of the skin) to prevent skin cancer is the general skin recommendation.

>Do elder people have to take any supplements specifically for their age?

As long as they're eating a balanced diet, i.e. a mostly plant-based whole grain diet, there's no evidence of nutritional deficiencies, and their weight is stable, then no. Don't waste your money on supplements.

>I met my father today after not seeing him for four months and I have gradually noticed that the way he smells reminds me more and more of the way my grandparents smelled.

[2-Nonenal]( is the smell associated with aging. As far as I know, it's benign.

>should he take any supplements or incorporate something into his life to support his health and this process of the body?

No, see above.

>I am just so afraid of not having him with me and I can't even fall asleep thinking of these bad things. With all my hearth I wish for him to live a long an happy life and I am afraid he stresses a lot about me and my younger sister because she goes through primary school drama and I try to end my life like the brat I am every other week. I have started my best doing my part to relief his stress that comes due to my personal problems, I just hope any doctor who has the time and energy can help me with these questions.

Unless your dad hasn't seen a doctor in years, he sounds otherwise healthy. Any internal medicine or family medicine doctor in a clinic can help him stay healthy. There are specialist doctors for the elderly called geriatricians that can be harder to find, but they specialize in the special needs of the elderly. However, this is usually the frail, limited mobility, and/or 3+ comorbid medical problems and prescription medications kind of patient. I have geriatric patients on my internal medicine primary care panel of patients who I am very comfortable managing.

It is still ***very*** early, but I would have your dad start thinking about how he wants to best live the rest of his life. Does he want to travel? Spend as much time with his family? What does he want to happen if he were to fall ill? Should doctors try to resuscitate him with chest compressions and put a breathing tube down his throat and have a machine breathe for him if he were not able to anymore? He should start to think about a living will or advanced directive ([an example]( if he wants to be prepared.

However, the vaccine is effective in preventing shingles and its complications, and the patient may be able to benefit from it despite not being approved for their age group.","Finish[The patient should discuss this with their doctor to determine the best course of action, but it seems like the benefits of vaccination likely outweigh the risks","Action: Finish[The Shingrix vaccine is not approved for people < 50 years old because there is a lack of data on its long-term safety and efficacy in younger populations. However, the vaccine is effective in preventing shingles and its complications, and the patient may be able to benefit from it despite not being approved for their age group.]",0.8,0.9,"My guess, and this is merely an educated guess, based on knowing stuff about vaccination etc.:

the 50 year recommendation is an old recommendation, based on population studies when chicken pox was still endemic (constantly circulating).  With the advent of the chicken pox vaccine, we are not getting re-exposed to chicken pox as often as we used to, which previously helped keep our immunity high.  

When we get a shingles outbreak, we think it's  when our immunity to varicella virus has waned enough that it can reactivate from dormancy in our nerves. (we don't know exactly how it works) 

[ 

shows that in those of us over 30, who likely had wild-type zoster (meaning we got chicken pox, prior to there being a vaccine available) are perhaps increasing our rates of shingles by a very small amount.  Under 30, there's not the rise, because the vaccine has lower rates of shingles, thankfully, than getting it naturally.  

So, if we are getting less exposure to maintain our immunity and shingles appears when our immunity wanes, it is a fairly logical deduction that perhaps those of us who are over thirty should perhaps get a shingles vaccine earlier than previously recommended.  BUT the immunity from the shingles vaccine wanes too, so if you get it earlier than recommended, there is a risk that it will leave you unprotected when the risks are even higher in your 70s.  And your risk of shingles under the age of 50 is still very low.  

In other words, it's not as clear cut as we think logically, and (despite antivaxxer's claims LOL), they try and give people the fewest immunizations as possible, especially because the more complicated you make it, the more likely someone is going to not get a needed dose when it is even more important.  

So getting the shingles vax at 30 might decrease your risk at 30-40 by 1-2%, but increases your risk at 75 or 80 by 30-40%.  That's not a good trade off, especially because your immune system in your 30s and 40s is strong enough that it will likely be able to deal with the shingles without any permanent issues - not true when you're older.  

It's an awkward stage to be in, I think, because of the advent of chicken pox vaccination, and by the time we figure it out conclusively, the younger end of those who got chicken pox naturally will have already gotten the shingles vaccine at 50.  

TLDR: It might give some small amount of help, but it could be concerning for raising your risks for shingles when you are much older, or may need another round of shingles vaccine (which has not been studied)  

again though, based on rates of incidence, your overall risk of shingles is so low before 50, so it just may be overkill. 

Please take this with lots of salts and caveats, I am not an immunologist nor infectious disease expert nor doing research in this topic, it's a personal area of curiosity and there is definitely some extrapolation going on here, and if someone with real expertise contradicts me, they are almost certainly right!",False,False,4,3,"1.

Thought 2: The patient is taking a 2-day break, which is a good sign",END,0.9,0.9,"It depends on what your definition of addiction is. If you mean addiction in the sense of having a compulsion to take the medication - probably not. You seem to have a good grasp of when to use it and when you should take breaks. That said there can be a tolerance to benzodiazepines that occurs over time if used too frequently (although exactly how frequently varies person to person). This can cause a spiral of increasing dosage which can be very challenging to get out of. This is what people are more likely to develop - a tolerance or dependence where abrupt discontinuation can be challenging due to rebound anxiety (among other things). Generally, benzos are recommended as acute medications which shouldn’t be used for more than a couple of weeks (in an ideal world, in reality this is far from true). Usage above this indicates that you may be better using a mood stabilizing medication such as an SSRI which can help limit your panic disorder and will help reduce your lorazepam usage. I would highly recommend consulting your primary care provider to pursue this treatment option as it is much more sustainable than near daily benzo usage. 

That said, even in a worst case scenario, benzos can be challenging but not impossible to get off of. Generally there is a phased taper off that occurs over several weeks to minimize withdrawal effects.",False,False,4,3,"1.

My previous answer was correct in that the patient's symptoms are likely benign and not requiring immediate medical attention. However, I may have been too hasty in concluding that a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist is not necessary. Given the patient's age and the fact that he has a history of these episodes, it would be more prudent to consider the possibility of underlying conditions that may not have been detected by a routine exam. A more thorough evaluation, possibly including an electrocardiogram (ECG) or other diagnostic tests, may be warranted to rule out conditions such as atrial fibrillation, anxiety disorders, or other cardiac issues.

The pain you describe matches sciatica - pain emerging from irritation / compression of the sciatic nerve. This is in most cases caused by a disc bulge / hernia. There are a few causes outside the spine that can irritate this nerve though. 

After the nerve exits the lower spine, it passes on the inside of the pelvic bottom before it goes further down in the thigh. In the pelvic bottom, the sciatic nerve lies only a few cm away from the rectum. It is actually a known fact that constipation can cause sciatica in some patients. This is because in constipation, the rectal ampulla can be so dilated from stool inside, that the nerve becomes compressed between the rectum and bones in the pelvis. 

You may have some sort of anatomic variant that makes you disposed to this kind of sciatica - the rectum may lie further to the left side than is normal, or the nerve has less ""fat-cushoning"" than normal. It's not impossible that something simple - like changing your diet to fiber-rich, or anything else to loosen up your stool, can help with the pain. You could try a laxative, and see if the pain is less when the stool is soft. 

I would also suggest you have a CT with iv contrast of your pelvis, just to make sure there isn't anything very unusual around the rectum.

I think you could certainly be evaluated initially by a Telehealth visit, and in fact I think you should start there, though be aware they may want you to see an in-person doctor after your visit depending on what they see. You are obviously the only one who can decide the right course of action here. The consequences for not seeing a doctor right away would be a low possibility of missing a stroke or some brain lesion causing his symptoms (even though this is unlikely). I personally feel it's better to be safe than sorry in these situations and get evaluated by someone who can do a thorough neurological examination.

My answer was incorrect because I did not fully consider the patient's negative test results and the fact that she did not exhibit typical symptoms of appendicitis. I should have given more weight to the negative findings of the ""jump test"" and the rebound tenderness test, which are commonly used to diagnose appendicitis. 

Next time, I will follow these rules:

1. I will carefully consider all the information provided, including both positive and negative findings, before making a diagnosis.
2. I will be more thorough in my analysis of the patient's symptoms and test results, and avoid making a diagnosis based solely"
