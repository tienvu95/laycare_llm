Yeah, they have the QTc prolongation warning but that’s super rare. And frankly, Pepcid isn’t even on my radar for that the change is so small. And ondansetron has to be in combo with a lot of other drugs with that risk for it to be an issue",False,False,0.9,0.9,4,3,"My answer was incorrect because I did not consider the potential for a more severe interaction between Odansetron and the patient's medications, particularly the combination of Omeprazole and Pepcid.

Any time we feel out of control like that, it can be terrifying, and it sounds like you haven't been given the proper tools to help you cope with it. Ideally, you would have had therapy during/after.

48322,"Take the statin, but with close monitoring of side effects and a discussion with their healthcare provider about the potential benefits and risks.","The patient has had a small stroke and is now considering taking statins. I know that statins are generally recommended for patients who have had a stroke to reduce the risk of another stroke. However, the patient is concerned about the potential side effects of statins, including muscle pain and cognitive and memory issues. I should consider the patient's individual circumstances and the potential risks and benefits of taking statins.","As my username implies, I would take a statin in this situation. 

There is ample evidence of the kind you are looking for - which compares people who took statins with people who didn't with regard to stroke prevention. I wouldn't bother reading abstracts of individual studies, the best place to go for something like this is a meta-analysis which summarizes all the research ever done on the topic. [This]( is a good example, a very comprehensive study commissioned by the US government to survey the role of statins in prevention. In one section, it says ""fatal or nonfatal stroke (13 trials; RR, 0.71 after 6 months to 6 years"", which means that there was an average 29% reduction in the incidence of stroke over the next 6 months to 6 years in the 13 trials which have been done on the topic. 

I understand your fear regarding side effects. This meta-analysis also discusses this issue in the paragraph ""Harms of Statin Treatment"". To summarize the relevant paragraph, statins are well tolerated and are not shown to cause any significant side effects, including muscle aches or cognitive issues. I understand there is a lot of bad press regarding statins with a lot of very vocal patient groups out there on the internet, but in the real world we see minimal issues with statins when used in very large numbers of our patients. 

If you are still concerned re side effects, a reasonable compromise is to take a low dose statin. There is a world of difference between 80mg of atorvastatin and 5mg of rosuvastatin in terms of risk of side effects, and the cholesterol lowering of 5mg of rosuvastatin is actually still quite good. For my patients who have concerns or bad experiences re the higher doses, I usually suggest 5mg of rosuvastatin and have never had a patient who had issues with this.

My reasoning was correct in identifying the patient's description as consistent with a xiphoid process.

>I  am 20 years old and recently lost my lovely dearest mother who was 46 years to cancer in January and now have only my father as closest family.

I am so sorry to hear that. Losing a parent at any age is hard, but I can imagine especially so as you transition between adolescence to young adulthood.

>when he will take PSA tests next time

For what it's worth, the recommendation behind routine PSA screening is controversial. The current United States Preventive Service Task Force recommendation is to leave the decision to screen up to the individual patient and his doctor. The reasoning is that there is a high rate of false positives, i.e. a cancer scare, that turns out to be negative. However, the workup for a cancer scare comes with the risk of complications and patients get harmed.

>Is there anything I can do to help him or recommend to him?

Yes, see an internal medicine, family medicine, or geriatric doctor (more info later) for an annual physical and ask what recommendations the doctors has to stay healthy. The rest of your post has a number of health myths or outdated medical advice that I will address.

>Maybe he should weight train and build muscle to reduce the chances of falling and breaking a bone \*knock on wood\*, maybe he should drink more water or should I buy him a face cream so that he can have a good barrier for his immune system?

Yes, regular weight-bearing exercises are good to help the elderly keep their muscle tone and prevent falls. Getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise (moderate pace walking, jogging, running, swimming bicycling, etc.) is also recommended to keep the heart healthy, keep blood pressure and cholesterol normal, and improve mood. As far as bone health goes, evidence for checking vitamin D and replacing vitamin D if low in otherwise healthy community-dwelling elderly adults to prevent falls is lacking. Unless he has another condition that increases his risk of bone fractures, he does not need any other tests, e.g. DEXA scan of his bones for osteoporosis.

Drinking a healthy amount of water is always a good idea; however,  it's hard to recommend how much water to drink and without knowing if your dad has an underlying diagnoses that would point him away from drinking too much water, i.e. chronic heart, lung, or liver disease. I will say that as people age, their thirst drive does diminish and the elderly have to be reminded to drink water or else they risk dehydration.

To my knowledge, there isn't evidence behind the benefits of face cream. Minimizing exposure to the sun, covering up skin,  regular use of sunscreen, and annual thorough skin exam (EVERY single centimeter of the skin) to prevent skin cancer is the general skin recommendation.

>Do elder people have to take any supplements specifically for their age?

As long as they're eating a balanced diet, i.e. a mostly plant-based whole grain diet, there's no evidence of nutritional deficiencies, and their weight is stable, then no. Don't waste your money on supplements.

>I met my father today after not seeing him for four months and I have gradually noticed that the way he smells reminds me more and more of the way my grandparents smelled.

[2-Nonenal]( is the smell associated with aging. As far as I know, it's benign.

>should he take any supplements or incorporate something into his life to support his health and this process of the body?

No, see above.

>I am just so afraid of not having him with me and I can't even fall asleep thinking of these bad things. With all my hearth I wish for him to live a long an happy life and I am afraid he stresses a lot about me and my younger sister because she goes through primary school drama and I try to end my life like the brat I am every other week. I have started my best doing my part to relief his stress that comes due to my personal problems, I just hope any doctor who has the time and energy can help me with these questions.

Unless your dad hasn't seen a doctor in years, he sounds otherwise healthy. Any internal medicine or family medicine doctor in a clinic can help him stay healthy. There are specialist doctors for the elderly called geriatricians that can be harder to find, but they specialize in the special needs of the elderly. However, this is usually the frail, limited mobility, and/or 3+ comorbid medical problems and prescription medications kind of patient. I have geriatric patients on my internal medicine primary care panel of patients who I am very comfortable managing.

It is still ***very*** early, but I would have your dad start thinking about how he wants to best live the rest of his life. Does he want to travel? Spend as much time with his family? What does he want to happen if he were to fall ill? Should doctors try to resuscitate him with chest compressions and put a breathing tube down his throat and have a machine breathe for him if he were not able to anymore? He should start to think about a living will or advanced directive ([an example]( if he wants to be prepared. This really far down the line, but as you are alluding to, the human body doesn't recover as well as it ages and I wouldn't want the family to have to make these sort of decisions if something unexpected were to happen to your dad and he cannot make decisions for himself in that setting.",False,False,,,4,3,"1.

22270,"The patient should discuss this with their doctor to understand the medical/biological reasons behind the approval process and consider paying out of pocket for the vaccine, as it seems to be an effective treatment for shingles.","The patient is considering paying out of pocket for the Shingrix vaccine, which suggests that they are motivated to receive the vaccine. However, the vaccine is not approved for individuals under 50 years old. I need to consider the potential reasons behind this approval restriction.","My guess, and this is merely an educated guess, based on knowing stuff about vaccination etc.:

the 50 year recommendation is an old recommendation, based on population studies when chicken pox was still endemic (constantly circulating).  With the advent of the chicken pox vaccine, we are not getting re-exposed to chicken pox as often as we used to, which previously helped keep our immunity high.  

When we get a shingles outbreak, we think it's  when our immunity to varicella virus has waned enough that it can reactivate from dormancy in our nerves. (we don't know exactly how it works) 

[ 

shows that in those of us over 30, who likely had wild-type zoster (meaning we got chicken pox, prior to there being a vaccine available) are perhaps increasing our rates of shingles by a very small amount.  Under 30, there's not the rise, because the vaccine has lower rates of shingles, thankfully, than getting it naturally.  

So, if we are getting less exposure to maintain our immunity and shingles appears when our immunity wanes, it is a fairly logical deduction that perhaps those of us who are over thirty should perhaps get a shingles vaccine earlier than previously recommended.  BUT the immunity from the shingles vaccine wanes too, so if you get it earlier than recommended, there is a risk that it will leave you unprotected when the risks are even higher in your 70s.  And your risk of shingles under the age of 50 is still very low.  

In other words, it's not as clear cut as we think logically, and (despite antivaxxer's claims LOL), they try and give people the fewest immunizations as possible, especially because the more complicated you make it, the more likely someone is going to not get a needed dose when it is even more important.  

So getting the shingles vax at 30 might decrease your risk at 30-40 by 1-2%, but increases your risk at 75 or 80 by 30-40%.  That's not a good trade off, especially because your immune system in your 30s and 40s is strong enough that it will likely be able to deal with the shingles without any permanent issues - not true when you're older.  

It's an awkward stage to be in, I think, because of the advent of chicken pox vaccination, and by the time we figure it out conclusively, the younger end of those who got chicken pox naturally will have already gotten the shingles vaccine at 50.  

TLDR: It might give some small amount of help, but it could be concerning for raising your risks for shingles when you are much older, or may need another round of shingles vaccine (which has not been studied)  

again though, based on rates of incidence, your overall risk of shingles is so low before 50, so it just may be overkill.

If you mean addiction in the sense of having a compulsion to take the medication - probably not. You seem to have a good grasp of when to use it and when you should take breaks. That said there can be a tolerance to benzodiazepines that occurs over time if used too frequently (although exactly how frequently varies person to person). This can cause a spiral of increasing dosage which can be very challenging to get out of. This is what people are more likely to develop - a tolerance or dependence where abrupt discontinuation can be challenging due to rebound anxiety (among other things). Generally, benzos are recommended as acute medications which shouldn’t be used for more than a couple of weeks (in an ideal world, in reality this is far from true). Usage above this indicates that you may be better using a mood stabilizing medication such as an SSRI which can help limit your panic disorder and will help reduce your lorazepam usage. I would highly recommend consulting your primary care provider to pursue this treatment option as it is much more sustainable than near daily benzo usage.

There may be a possible explanation for this. The pain you describe matches sciatica - pain emerging from irritation / compression of the sciatic nerve.

After the nerve exits the lower spine, it passes on the inside of the pelvic bottom before it goes further down in the thigh. In the pelvic bottom, the sciatic nerve lies only a few cm away from the rectum. It is actually a known fact that constipation can cause sciatica in some patients. This is because in constipation, the rectal ampulla can be so dilated from stool inside, that the nerve becomes compressed between the rectum and bones in the pelvis. 

You may have some sort of anatomic variant that makes you disposed to this kind of sciatica - the rectum may lie further to the left side than is normal, or the nerve has less ""fat-cushoning"" than normal.

Does she have a doctor now? If not, the first appointment should ideally be a “meet and greet” so she can get to know her doc and the doc can get all her background info: past surgeries, family history, any meds she takes, that sort of thing. Probably a blood pressure check and she’ll probably be asked to get some lab work done for basic screening tests (diabetes check, cholesterol). This appointment has a LOT to it (even if she does already know the doctor, they have 30 years to catch up on!), and this visit is best done without going over any active health issues to get through all the necessary stuff. The best time to do this is when she’s healthy and has nothing going on, so it sounds like now might be a great time to do this.

Then she should book appointment #2. That will probably be another blood pressure check and to go over the lab work results, or else a well woman exam, but not both. To do either of those things properly they each need their own appointment, your mom and doc can decide on visit #1 which one is best. 

If she has any active health issues too (knee pain, back pain, etc), they really do need their own appointment so they don’t get shortchanged.
