Ditto /u/sapphireminds ‘s succinct explanation as to what the drug does, and I’ll add further. This special type of diuretic helps decrease the pressure in your head. The goal of this is to thereby improve symptoms like headache, visual issues etc as well as reduce the swelling of your optic nerves (I imagine you had someone look in the back of your eyes, which usually shows papilledema aka optic nerve head/disc swelling in IIH patients) to prevent further or worsened damage to your vision. 

I don’t want to frighten you, but I did want to be clear in case the other neuro wasn’t about something critical to know about IIH. Not addressing this with weight loss and medication can potentially lead to continued damage to your optic nerves, possibly leading to long standing or even permanent vision disturbances/loss. 

With lifestyle changes and modest weight loss, many patients can be tapered down or even completely weaned off the medication. Most likely this wouldn’t be for at least several months to a year from diagnosis and treatment initiation. There are other drugs that can be added, doses adjusted, etc while working on weight loss if symptoms or papilledema worsen in spite of treatment. 

So basically, I can’t predict if you will or will not need acetazolamide for future long term use. It depends in part to how your body responds to the drug and following up with your neurologist if inadequately treated after a few weeks, to ensure optimal medical therapy for you. Ultimately weight loss is the most effective and potentially curative treatment for IIH. Much easier said than done, but it is important to try your best at losing weight, stay the course and not get discouraged since this condition takes awhile to improve, and take your medication as prescribed. And of course, don’t hesitate to look for another neurologist if the one who you initially saw didn’t click well with you.",0.9,False,"Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, thereby lowering intracranial pressure.

(Also, please note","I’m an adult neurologist (resident). Ditto /u/sapphireminds ‘s succinct explanation as to what the drug does, and I’ll add further. This special type of diuretic helps decrease the pressure in your head. The goal of this is to thereby improve symptoms like headache, visual issues etc as well as reduce the swelling of your optic nerves (I imagine you had someone look in the back of your eyes, which usually shows papilledema aka optic nerve head/disc swelling in IIH patients) to prevent further or worsened damage to your vision. I don’t want to frighten you, but I did want to be clear in case the other neuro wasn’t about something critical to know about IIH.

Thought 2: The microscopic examination also shows that the B cells are negative for bcl-2, which is a marker for follicular lymphoma. This suggests that the lymphoma is not of the follicular type. Additionally, the cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CD-43, and cyclin D-1 are negative, which rules out other types of lymphomas.
Thought 3: The flow cytometric immunophenotyping shows a small atypical B cell population, which is consistent with the microscopic findings. The presence of a small population of CD-10 positive cells suggests that the lymphoma may be of the Burkitt type.
Action: Finish[High Grade B Cell Lymphoma, likely Burkitt type]","I can help decipher some of this. First off, you should know that cancers are assessed by STAGE and GRADE. 

- **Grade** indicates how similar to normal tissue they appear visually: high grade is dissimilar to normal tissue; low grade is similar to normal tissue

- **Stage** indicates the spread of a tumor: high stage cancer has metastasized; low stage cancer is localized

Unfortunately, I'm not as familiar with the prognosis of lymphomas as I should be, so I can't offer much insight there. The rest of the report describes what markers the cancer cells had or didn't have. Here's what each of them mean:

- **CD20** just indicates its a B-Cell lymphoma (a specific type of lymphocyte)
- **Ki67** is an indicates of cell proliferation. Basically, it measures how rapidly the cancer cells are growing. Leukemia and lymphoma both tend to have much higher Ki-67 readings than other cancers. While a high Ki67 reading does indicate a high rate of growth, it also means that those cells are *very* susceptible to chemotherapy. So assuming you're able to begin therapy promptly, a high Ki-67 is actually probably a good thing.

- **Bcl-2** is a marker for a particular type of lymphoma called Follicular Lymphoma. Yours was Bcl-2 negative, and is therefore *not* follicular lymphoma

- **CD-3 and CD-5** are just T-Cell markers (another specific type of lymphocyte). In this case, I believe the report is referencing non-cancer cells with these markers.

- **Cyclin D-1** is the marker for another type of lymphoma called Mantle Cell lymphoma. Again, yours was negative, and is therefore *not* Mantle Cell lymphoma.

As you already know as the brother of someone with sickle cell disease, SSD causes tremendous suffering. Not only are there acute painful crises, but there is often the development of chronic pain, damage to the internal organs, permanent disability, and the side effects of medications (especially of long-term opioid pain medicine use).

A brief primer:

SSD is a conduit where your hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying protein) inside your red blood cells has a mistake in it. This mistake allows the hemoglobin to form chains by linking up. Ordinarily, the millions of hemoglobin proteins do not link up at all. When they do, the chains cause your red blood cells to change shape from roundish to more like a bent stick - a ""sickle"" shape. Because they are not round they can clog up the small blood vessels (capillaries) like a logjam. Lack of blood flow produces pain and other problems.

So when people with SSD have severe recurrent crises, or other specific severe problems, sometimes an exchange transfusion is used. This is exactly what it sounds like: they exchange the patients blood for someone else's blood. They removed the blood that can sickle, and replace it with blood that cannot.

This temporarily.improves the situation, but blood cells eventually die, and the patient's body produces more (sickle) blood.

> Are these safe?

As safe as any blood transfusion. Pretty safe, although there are risks. A large IV catheter is needed, and this can cause problems people who have recurrent transfusions can develop problems.

>  Will he be okay for a while after this? 

Usually, after an exchange transfusion, the patient will be free of painful crises for a few months.


> It’s pretty terrifying going through this.

Some heavy duty detergents, however, will cause chemical burns on the way down.",0.8,False,"The patient has been ingesting dish soap for about a year, which is a significant amount of time. This suggests that the effects may not be immediate but rather long-term.
Thought 2: The patient is concerned about brain damage or organ damage, which are serious potential effects. However, the patient also mentions that they haven’t felt sick or experienced any other symptoms.
Thought 3: The patient has had diarrhoea a few times recently, which could be a sign of gastrointestinal irritation or damage.
Action: Finish[The patient should be evaluated by a healthcare provider to assess the potential long-term effects of ingesting dish soap. Given the patient's symptoms of diarrhoea, it is possible that there may be some gastrointestinal irritation or damage.

If it was meningitis, I would expect that both ears would have been affected. The hearing in your bad ear could in theory be restored with a cochlear implant. But (and it's a big but), if it was due to meningitis, the cochlea can become obliterated with bone, making this impossible. If the cochlea is still present, cochlear implantation may also be difficult because of the malformation issue you describe (wide vestibular aqueduct?). There is also a significant cost issue with cochlear implants. Other options include a CROS hearing aid which helps to overcome the ""head shadow effect"".","The patient had meningitis at age 8, which led to the loss of her right ear. Meningitis is an infection that inflames the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges. This inflammation can lead to complications such as hearing loss, which in this case resulted in the loss of the patient's right ear.
Thought 2: The patient is asking if there is a current medicine or technique that can restore her right ear. Unfortunately, once an ear is damaged or lost due to meningitis, it is generally not possible to restore it. However, there are treatments available to help manage hearing loss and improve communication, such as cochlear implants or hearing aids.

14240,"There is a limit to the number of vaccinations that can be effective, but it is not well defined.","Thought 3: The question is asking about the limit or declining benefit of vaccinations. I know that the immune system can remember a large number of vaccinations, but the immune system does not get ""full"" like computer memory.
Action 3: Finish[The immune system does not get ""full"" like computer memory.]","Is there a limit to immune system ""memory""?

 - Nope. Your immune system is in contact with 100s to 1000s of things daily (from your skin, your gut, your kids, the air, etc.) and has space to categorize all those on a harmful-harmless scale. Sometimes it gets stuff wrong (see: allergies), sometimes it gets too excited (see: autoimmune), sometimes it forgets what it learned prior. But it can always learn new things, even if it slows down on how well it learns those.

How many different things can someone be vaccinated for?

 - There's no real top limit here. Again, your immune system encounters exponentially more out in the world than it does through vaccines. We decide what to vaccinate for based on what's available, what's common/contagious enough, and prior evidence of when individual protection wears thin. But there are more bacterial cells on/in your body than there are human cells. Your immune system has plenty of space. :)

Do the older vaccinations wear off as new vaccinations are received, or do they fade away by age or something else?

 - Older vaccinations of some subtypes can ""wear off"" or separately become less effective, but this is more a product of the type of vaccine and the disease agent itself, not the immune system filling up. For instance, most people never need MMR again after a 2-shot series (some even have full immunity after 1 shot), same for HiB vaccines and polio. However, we know the tetanus and pertussis components of the Tdap/DTap vaccine do wane over time, lasting 5-10 years each, so we booster that pretty regularly in adults. Other vaccines covered a previous variant of the illness but not the current circulating one (see: flu), so we give a new one to help train the immune system on the new one. What fades and why is complicated and has some to do with what specific parts we are vaccinating for (i.e., for tetanus and pertussis it's actually a toxoid vaccine, where we train the immune system to recognize the bacterial product and not the bacteria itself) as well as other things above my paygrade.

Can an immune system get ""full"" like computer memory? IE If I get a flu shot does the Hepatitis vaccine from years ago get forgotten or does everything just keep adding on to ""things I have an immunity to""?

 - No, the immune system doesn't get full. It can forget things for a variety of reasons, or it can fail to respond to a vaccine in the first place (one the reasons some of the childhood shots are series is that a certain percentage of people have immunity after one shot while a larger group is fully protected after 2). 

These are all kind of variations on a theme, so just to repeat the theme - your immune system encounters an incredible number of pathogens a day, no matter how spotless you keep yourself and your house.

Cystic-appearing lesions in the spleen are very common and are not concerning.

It's actually pretty unusual that they would have recommended a follow-up scan in 6 months, because there are specific imaging criteria that basically guarantee that a splenic lesion is benign and can be ignored.","The patient has a cyst on the spleen, which is a relatively rare condition.

Action 1: The patient's symptoms and description suggest a xiphoid process, which is a normal anatomical variant that can appear and solidify over time. However, the patient's concern about its sudden appearance at 34 years old warrants further investigation.

Thought 2: The patient's age and symptoms are consistent with a xiphoid process, but the fact that he has never felt it before and is now concerned about its presence suggests that further evaluation is necessary to rule out any potential underlying conditions.

Action 1: Thought that the patient's feelings and concerns are valid and should be taken seriously.

Thought 2: The patient is questioning whether the doctor's touch was normal or if it was an absent-minded action.
Action 2: Thought that the doctor's touch may have been a normal part of the examination, but the patient's feelings and concerns should still be acknowledged and addressed.

FYI, rust doesn't actually transmit tetanus. We worry about tetanus with deep wounds, especially dirty ones.",,False,"The patient had two doses of tetanus booster within 6 months. This is a relatively short period, and I need to consider the potential risks of this scenario.
Action 1: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that adults receive a tetanus booster every 10 years. Having two doses within 6 months is not a typical scenario, but it's not uncommon for people to receive multiple doses in a short period due to various reasons, such as travel or occupational exposure. In this case, the patient received the booster due to a cut from a rusty blade, which is a legitimate reason for vaccination. However, the patient's recent vaccination history suggests that they may have received the booster too soon after the previous dose.

Thought 2: The patient's recent vaccination history suggests that they may have received the booster too soon after the previous dose. According to the CDC, a tetanus booster should be given at least 10 years after the previous dose. However, the patient received the booster only 4 months after the previous dose, which is a relatively short period. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions or reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.

I am so sorry to hear that. Losing a parent at any age is hard, but I can imagine especially so as you transition between adolescence to young adulthood.

>when he will take PSA tests next time

For what it's worth, the recommendation behind routine PSA screening is controversial. The current United States Preventive Service Task Force recommendation is to leave the decision to screen up to the individual patient and his doctor. The reasoning is that there is a high rate of false positives, i.e. a cancer scare, that turns out to be negative. However, the workup for a cancer scare comes with the risk of complications and patients get harmed.

>Is there anything I can do to help him or recommend to him?

Yes, see an internal medicine, family medicine, or geriatric doctor (more info later) for an annual physical and ask what recommendations the doctors has to stay healthy. The rest of your post has a number of health myths or outdated medical advice that I will address.

>Maybe he should weight train and build muscle to reduce the chances of falling and breaking a bone \*knock on wood\*, maybe he should drink more water or should I buy him a face cream so that he can have a good barrier for his immune system?

Yes, regular weight-bearing exercises are good to help the elderly keep their muscle tone and prevent falls. Getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise (moderate pace walking, jogging, running, swimming bicycling, etc.) is also recommended to keep the heart healthy, keep blood pressure and cholesterol normal, and improve mood. As far as bone health goes, evidence for checking vitamin D and replacing vitamin D if low in otherwise healthy community-dwelling elderly adults to prevent falls is lacking. Unless he has another condition that increases his risk of bone fractures, he does not need any other tests, e.g. DEXA scan of his bones for osteoporosis.

Drinking a healthy amount of water is always a good idea; however,  it's hard to recommend how much water to drink and without knowing if your dad has an underlying diagnoses that would point him away from drinking too much water, i.e. chronic heart, lung, or liver disease. I will say that as people age, their thirst drive does diminish and the elderly have to be reminded to drink water or else they risk dehydration.

To my knowledge, there isn't evidence behind the benefits of face cream. Minimizing exposure to the sun, covering up skin,  regular use of sunscreen, and annual thorough skin exam (EVERY single centimeter of the skin) to prevent skin cancer is the general skin recommendation.

>Do elder people have to take any supplements specifically for their age?

As long as they're eating a balanced diet, i.e. a mostly plant-based whole grain diet, there's no evidence of nutritional deficiencies, and their weight is stable, then no. Don't waste your money on supplements.

>I met my father today after not seeing him for four months and I have gradually noticed that the way he smells reminds me more and more of the way my grandparents smelled.

[2-Nonenal]( is the smell associated with aging. As far as I know, it's benign.

>should he take any supplements or incorporate something into his life to support his health and this process of the body?

No, see above.

>I am just so afraid of not having him with me and I can't even fall asleep thinking of these bad things. With all my hearth I wish for him to live a long an happy life and I am afraid he stresses a lot about me and my younger sister because she goes through primary school drama and I try to end my life like the brat I am every other week.

Unless your dad hasn't seen a doctor in years, he sounds otherwise healthy. Any internal medicine or family medicine doctor in a clinic can help him stay healthy.

the 50 year recommendation is an old recommendation, based on population studies when chicken pox was still endemic (constantly circulating).  With the advent of the chicken pox vaccine, we are not getting re-exposed to chicken pox as often as we used to, which previously helped keep our immunity high.  

When we get a shingles outbreak, we think it's  when our immunity to varicella virus has waned enough that it can reactivate from dormancy in our nerves. (we don't know exactly how it works) 

[ 

shows that in those of us over 30, who likely had wild-type zoster (meaning we got chicken pox, prior to there being a vaccine available) are perhaps increasing our rates of shingles by a very small amount.  Under 30, there's not the rise, because the vaccine has lower rates of shingles, thankfully, than getting it naturally.  

So, if we are getting less exposure to maintain our immunity and shingles appears when our immunity wanes, it is a fairly logical deduction that perhaps those of us who are over thirty should perhaps get a shingles vaccine earlier than previously recommended.  BUT the immunity from the shingles vaccine wanes too, so if you get it earlier than recommended, there is a risk that it will leave you unprotected when the risks are even higher in your 70s.  And your risk of shingles under the age of 50 is still very low.  

In other words, it's not as clear cut as we think logically, and (despite antivaxxer's claims LOL), they try and give people the fewest immunizations as possible, especially because the more complicated you make it, the more likely someone is going to not get a needed dose when it is even more important.  

So getting the shingles vax at 30 might decrease your risk at 30-40 by 1-2%, but increases your risk at 75 or 80 by 30-40%.  That's not a good trade off, especially because your immune system in your 30s and 40s is strong enough that it will likely be able to deal with the shingles without any permanent issues - not true when you're older.  

It's an awkward stage to be in, I think, because of the advent of chicken pox vaccination, and by the time we figure it out conclusively, the younger end of those who got chicken pox naturally will have already gotten the shingles vaccine at 50.  

TLDR: It might give some small amount of help, but it could be concerning for raising your risks for shingles when you are much older, or may need another round of shingles vaccine (which has not been studied)  

again though, based on rates of incidence, your overall risk of shingles is so low before 50, so it just may be overkill.

There may be a possible explanation for this. The pain you describe matches sciatica - pain emerging from irritation / compression of the sciatic nerve. This is in most cases caused by a disc bulge / hernia. There are a few causes outside the spine that can irritate this nerve though. 

After the nerve exits the lower spine, it passes on the inside of the pelvic bottom before it goes further down in the thigh. In the pelvic bottom, the sciatic nerve lies only a few cm away from the rectum. It is actually a known fact that constipation can cause sciatica in some patients. This is because in constipation, the rectal ampulla can be so dilated from stool inside, that the nerve becomes compressed between the rectum and bones in the pelvis. 

You may have some sort of anatomic variant that makes you disposed to this kind of sciatica - the rectum may lie further to the left side than is normal, or the nerve has less ""fat-cushoning"" than normal. It's not impossible that something simple - like changing your diet to fiber-rich, or anything else to loosen up your stool, can help with the pain.

It can sometimes be difficult to tell, though. One of the classic differences between Bell's palsy and a stroke is the forehead muscles.

If he can wrinkle or move his forehead and brow muscles, this would be more concerning for a central nerve problem such as a stroke or brain lesion.

Confidence: 0.9  // I am 90% confident that my answer is","Based on his age and lack of risk factors for stroke, it would be more likely to be Bell's palsy. It can sometimes be difficult to tell, though. One of the classic differences between Bell's palsy and a stroke is the forehead muscles. If he cannot move or wrinkle his forehead and brow muscles at all, this would be more consistent with a peripheral nerve problem such as Bell's palsy. If he can wrinkle or move his forehead and brow muscles, this would be more concerning for a central nerve problem such as a stroke or brain lesion. I think you could certainly be evaluated initially by a Telehealth visit, and in fact I think you should start there, though be aware they may want you to see an in-person doctor after your visit depending on what they see. You are obviously the only one who can decide the right course of action here. The consequences for not seeing a doctor right away would be a low possibility of missing a stroke or some brain lesion causing his symptoms (even though this is unlikely).

Does she have a doctor now? If not, the first appointment should ideally be a “meet and greet” so she can get to know her doc and the doc can get all her background info: past surgeries, family history, any meds she takes, that sort of thing. Probably a blood pressure check and she’ll probably be asked to get some lab work done for basic screening tests (diabetes check, cholesterol). This appointment has a LOT to it (even if she does already know the doctor, they have 30 years to catch up on!), and this visit is best done without going over any active health issues to get through all the necessary stuff. The best time to do this is when she’s healthy and has nothing going on, so it sounds like now might be a great time to do this.

Then she should book appointment #2. That will probably be another blood pressure check and to go over the lab work results, or else a well woman exam, but not both. To do either of those things properly they each need their own appointment, your mom and doc can decide on visit #1 which one is best. 

If she has any active health issues too (knee pain, back pain, etc), they really do need their own appointment so they don’t get shortchanged. If there is something urgent your mom is worried about, which is why sometimes people are scared to go, it’s still going to take 2 appointments at least to get it sorted out because we often need bloodwork or tests and to see you back before we know what’s up.

Please give your answer in the","If she hasn’t been to a doctor in over 30 years, she needs multiple appointments to get caught up. Does she have a doctor now? If not, the first appointment should ideally be a “meet and greet” so she can get to know her doc and the doc can get all her background info: past surgeries, family history, any meds she takes, that sort of thing. Probably a blood pressure check and she’ll probably be asked to get some lab work done for basic screening tests (diabetes check, cholesterol). This appointment has a LOT to it (even if she does already know the doctor, they have 30 years to catch up on!), and this visit is best done without going over any active health issues to get through all the necessary stuff. The best time to do this is when she’s healthy and has nothing going on, so it sounds like now might be a great time to do this. Then she should book appointment #2. That will probably be another blood pressure check and to go over the lab work results, or else a well woman exam, but not both. To do either of those things properly they each need their own appointment, your mom and doc can decide on visit #1 which one is best. If she has any active health issues too (knee pain, back pain, etc), they really do need their own appointment so they don’t get shortchanged. If there is something urgent your mom is worried about, which is why sometimes people are scared to go, it’s still going to take 2 appointments at least to get it sorted out because we often need bloodwork or tests and to see you back before we know what’s up. Hopefully that helps! Tell your mom not to be nervous, we love to see people who haven’t seen us before or not in a long time.
