(On mobile, so I apologize for formatting issues)

My periods have generally been irregular since I started getting them at age 12.  However, I am currently 75 days into my cycle with no signs of my next period.  I am 100% sure I am not pregnant since I haven’t had sex in almost a year.  My cycle is usually about 28-35 days, with one other irregular cycle lasting 60 days two years ago. 

My OB/GYN had me tested a few years ago to see if there were any hormonal issues. My prolactin levels were slightly high, but not enough to be of any concern. 

I plan to go to my doctor soon, but any ideas about what may be causing this or how to regulate it would be much appreciated. ","Could be a prolactinoma, pcos, thyroid, etc. the best thing to do is see endocrine or obgyn to get some labs. Any other symptoms would help guide the work up but they’ll check common things first","Irregular periods becoming more irregular (NOT PREGNANT)

16253,Medical Issue That I nor my Doctors have figured out yet and is driving me INSANE (pls help)," 

Hey there first off thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this or reach out a helping hand in anyway (I apologise if this winds up being long but its the only way for me to express and go in depth to this horrible medical issue).

I have had an issue for the past 17+ years that is ruining my life in more ways then one and hoping someone may know the cure or remedy. When I was 14 (i am now 31) I was playing soccer and out of nowhere my throat just tightened up and I started to gag. The coach took me off the field and I begged him to go back in and so he did. I got back on the field and within 5 minutes of running , My throat tightened again and I started non stop gagging. This had NEVER happened to me before so I was dumbfounded by it, I had been playing sports my entire life and SUPER active with no issues then all of a sudden this? The very next day I played in a basketball game and BAM again it happened while i was taking a foul shot. My throat tightened and I start gagging uncontrollably. This was only happening to me when I was doing sports or strenuous activities. It was even happening when I would run or play with friends.

As time went on it got worse, It would happen when I was out with friends just hanging out or even at home doing nothing. There are times I dont feel the throat tighting and its not there at all then all of a sudden it just comes on. It is almost like my throat is contracting on its own? Here are the exact symptoms to help explain everything better

1. Lump like feeling that comes on out of nowhere, It becomes the worst when I'm working out/playing sports/sexual activity/drink coffee or energy drink and it its at its WORST when I'm having anxiety or stress.
2. The feeling isn't there all the time but it comes on out of nowhere. There are days where its better then others.
3. When I turn my neck to the right something feels like it pops in my throat but it only happens on the right side.
4. The feeling is ALOT better or relieved more when I chew something like gum/mints or when im drinking water.
5. The symptoms are 10x worse when my stomach is full or I finished eating. They are also uncontrollable when I don't get enough sleep..if I get anything under 8 hours of sleep I just feel like ima gag 24/7.
6. The symptoms of this have caused me to develop massive anxiety which heightens the gag / throat tightness even more which makes it almost uncontrollable.

I have seen alot of forums where people describe exact symptoms to mine but I have literally never found anyone respond saying something like ""hey guys i wound up finding out what it is here is the cure/answer"" , now obviously this could be a million different things but im really hoping someone here can lead me in the right direction or give me some advice. I have talked to multiple doctors and they have said it could be the following

1. Anxiety / Stress: Which i know it isn't because i have taking a bunch of different anxiety medications and even tried CBD oil at the highest dose all which did literally nothing to resolve the throat tension / gag feeling in my throat. Also there are days where i'm having 0 anxiety and that feeling is still there. The anxiety is brought on by the feeling in the throat not the other way around.
2. GERD: I have tried taking Omeprazole (i believe its called) and that did nothing which was prescribed to me by the doctor. I also have a VERY healthy diet so I know its not the way I'm eating or drinking. I workout every other day and eat keto/paleo. I also don't smoke/don't drink or eat / drink bad things.

I have been doing research for a very long time now and have thinking it could possibly be

1. Cricopharyngeal Spasm: However this is supposed to go away in like a month maximum yet i've had this for 17 years so is this even a possiblity at this point? Because this really describes my symptoms the best.
2. Esophagal spasms: Similar to the cricopharyngeal spasm idea
3. Enflamed Esophagas?? - Maybe from having this go untreated for so long i've developed damage there?
4. Hyroid Bone rubbing up against my thyroid tissue - Now i've read about this which would explain the popping in my throat but i never read that is associated with gagging symptoms , is this a possiblity?

I have gotten an X-Ray from a chiropractor cause I thought maybe it was my Hyroid bone but that came back totally normal (which to be honest I still feel is possible and that maybe he didnt catch it pop out when it pops in my throat if thats even what is popping in the first place?) and I have gotten thyroid ultrasounds which came back normal as well. The only test I havn't had is a CT Scan.

So at this point I'm totally lost and need guidance or someone who is willing to help me. I'll do literally anything for someone to help me figure this out as it has really has put a burden on my life cause it has stopped me from doing so many things. I'm afraid to go out in public in fear of gagging infront of people and i've stopped playing sports which I love to do. This has turned me into someone I am not, paralyzed me in a way. I want to go back to the person I was before all this and will do literally ANYTHING for someone to help me officially diagnose it or guide me.",May be worthwhile getting worked up for Achalasia cardia from what you described.

Additionally, I used to take Isoprinosine for more than 12 months with breaks in between. I also took natural remedies such as aloe vera gel, propolis, quail eggs - basically you name it - I've drunk it.

To be honest, I haven't noticed a great change in my energy levels, however, I haven't had a bad cold in a while so they might be working.

My question is - do taking supplements as long as this does any effect on the organism? Should I take a break, start taking other supplements? If I take a break how long should it be?

edit- I would like to say one more thing and that is, some 3 years ago I had ultrasound of my belly, they sad I have some type of intestinal infections, due to financial reasons I could not continue my medications of that infection. So I pretty much ignored it. 

I also get constant red colored swelling on my tongue and area around it. Like mouth ulcer but not pimples like bumps on it, it's just constant swelling because of it sometimes even water stings while drinking.

I also get very very sharp pain on the right side of my stomach for like 2-3 seconds , which stops my body completely. but after 2-3 seconds maximum being 5-7 seconds things go back on as usual.

edit- I would like to say one more thing and that is, some 3 years ago I had ultrasound of my belly, they sad I have some type of intestinal infections, due to financial reasons I could not continue my medications of that infection. So I pretty much ignored it. 

I also get constant red colored swelling on my tongue and area around it. Like mouth ulcer but not pimples like bumps on it, it's just constant swelling because of it sometimes even water stings while drinking.

I also get very very sharp pain on the right side of my stomach for like 2-3 seconds , which stops my body completely. but after 2-3 seconds maximum being 5-7 seconds things go back on as usual.

I immediately started trying to ""pop"" these blackheads, and broke through the skin on my right hand. Nothing came out of the holes. Photographed is my left hand.

34793,I'm a mtf transgender woman on hormone therapy. I'm afraid that surgery I had as a youngster is making breast development on one side impossible.,"When I was an adolescent, I grew a hard lump on my chest beneath the nipple. Bring a cis male little boy as far as the rest of the world was concerned, my parents took me to a doctor who performed surgery and found it to be a cyst in the undeveloped breast tissue.

This was a long time ago, so I honestly haven't given the event any thought in years.

I'm on hormones now, and despite many changes in my mind and body, one thing that hasn't changed is one side of my chest. It's not just that there's small or minimal development; I know that breasts can bud and develop at an uneven pace sometimes. It's that I'm not feeling any of the physical precursors that I felt and have been feeling on the other side. It's the same flat, minimally sensitive piece of anatomy that it's always been.

So now I have to ask the question: What exactly was done to that side of my chest? Is it possible that, in removing the cyst, the doc also removed any breast tissue that could have ever developed? If that is what happened, is there any chance of growth or recovery due to my hormone treatment, or do I need to get prepared for the idea of cosmetic surgery to fix the issue?

I was never excited about the idea of breast implants, but now I am at least halfway convinced. Hey-o

EDIT: More info, you say?

The cyst removal occured when I was in the 13/14 year old range. I'm now 33. I've been on hormones for almost a year. Breast development began maybe four months ago

So, yes, it's early for me to start losing hope. The other side might just be taking its sweet time. I'm open to that.

As for what exactly the doc did, I'll have to find the records, like one comment suggested. Neither of my parents recall the event with much clarity, and while they do have a name for the doctor who did the surgery, he has since passed and the practice hasn't been around for awhile, at least not in the location I remember. But the records must be somewhere, right?

Lastly, yes I'm going to see my doctor about this soon. However, I don't think it's any secret that being in a doctor's examination room in your underwear can erode on your ability to engage in a meaningful discussion with them about all the possibilities behind a medical issue, so I wanted to have a sense of what our talk might be like. No one wants to get sideswiped by a diagnosis of 'one-titty-itis'.","Hey there. I am also a physician but disagree with /u/Edronline: even if the procedure was considered a success and the op note only reports excision of a benign cyst, this could have reduced the amount of viable breast bud (especially in a adolescent male). Even minimally invasive procs in the pre-female-pubescent subareolar breast can lead to more pronounced asymmetry later in life. For this reason, we are reluctant to do biopsies in female children (especially since nearly all such biopsies are benign before puberty starts to stimulate the bud). 

But even if the male breast has never been touched with a scalpel, the buds are often asymmetric. We see this in older men with gynecomastia all the time. Normal variant. 

Now if the old op note says that a part of the bud was excised, then you have the likely answer. If no mention of other tissue removed, then you don’t know. This could just be asymmetric exogenous hormone effect due to the way you formed. Or it could be from your surgery. 

Consider talking to your endocrinologist overseeing your transition. Perhaps breast imaging may help elucidate the cause

Disclaimer: I’m trained in breast imaging and breast procedures. I’m not trained in gender reassignment therapy or reproductive endocrinology.","I'm a mtf transgender woman on hormone therapy. I'm afraid that surgery I had as a youngster is making breast development on one side impossible.

When I was an adolescent, I grew a hard lump on my chest beneath the nipple. Bring a cis male little boy as far as the rest of the world was concerned, my parents took me to a doctor who performed surgery and found it to be a cyst in the undeveloped breast tissue.

This was a long time ago, so I honestly haven't given the event any thought in years.

I'm on hormones now, and despite many changes in my mind and body, one thing that hasn't changed is one side of my chest. It's not just that there's small or minimal development; I know that breasts can bud and develop at an uneven pace sometimes. It's that I'm not feeling any of the physical precursors that I felt and have been feeling on the other side. It's the same flat, minimally sensitive piece of anatomy that it's always been.

So now I have to ask the question: What exactly was done to that side of my chest? Is it possible that, in removing the cyst, the doc also removed any breast tissue that could have ever developed? If that is what happened, is there any chance of growth or recovery due to my hormone treatment, or do I need to get prepared for the idea of cosmetic surgery to fix the issue?

I was never excited about the idea of breast implants, but now I am at least halfway convinced. Hey-o

EDIT: More info, you say?

The cyst removal occured when I was in the 13/14 year old range. I'm now 33. I've been on hormones for almost a year. Breast development began maybe four months ago

So, yes, it's early for me to start losing hope. The other side might just be taking its sweet time. I'm open to that.

As for what exactly the doc did, I'll have to find the records, like one comment suggested. Neither of my parents recall the event with much clarity, and while they do have a name for the doctor who did the surgery, he has since passed and the practice hasn't been around for awhile, at least not in the location I remember. But the records must be somewhere, right?

Lastly, yes I'm going to see my doctor about this soon.

However, without access to the medical records, it's difficult to determine the extent of the surgery and its impact on breast tissue. Hormone therapy may still stimulate some breast growth, but the likelihood of significant development on the affected side is uncertain.

Well, lo and behold, I was immediately diagnosed with severe Polycistic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). However, as soon as I was told what was wrong, my gynecologist told me to step on the scale. Um, okay, I guess? I'm 170cm tall and used to weigh around 58kg. She told me that my weight was, in fact, the reason for my PCOS and therefore need to lose at least 3kg to get better.

But you know, doctors know best, I guess, so I just took the advice. I lost not 3, but almost 6kg by the end of the month, and my next period was exactly the same.

11024,How much does unstable housing affect a treatment plan?,"The title of my post is the TL;DR

My father died a few years ago and I still feel like I contributed to his death by being unwilling to let him live with me. He had an aggressive liver or bile duct cancer and an unstable relationship with a woman who kept kicking him out. 

I took him to the ER the last time she kicked him out because he was unable to stand and delusional. A merciful ER doctor found a reason to admit him. I thought if he got admitted, it would give me time to find housing for him, some kind of nursing facility. In hindsight, I was naïve about what options he had.

They were going to remove his gallbladder because he either had tumors or gallstones (he had a long history of these) and thought that was the cause of his delusional mental state. Ultimately, they canceled this surgery and withdrew access to chemo. This seemed reasonable to me since I thought he had cholangiocarcinoma with no chance of survival. However, 

a) the last hospital told me he had liver cancer, not bile duct cancer.

b) one doctor said he was not a good candidate for chemo because of his unstable housing. I said I would take him to my house if that were the only reason. He assured me it wasn't that.  The chemo was pretty obviously not working, imo, and he had spots on his lungs and something going on with his gallbladder which suggested possible spread.

c) while filling out hospice paperwork, the floor doctor asked if my father would want to go to hospice or if he would want to continue treatment. The way he said it made me think he thought I was doing the wrong thing. I didn't know what to say. My father would want to continue treatment but I thought there was no treatment available? I regret not asking what he meant. Maybe I should have pushed for more tests? 

Would things have turned out differently if I had volunteered to bring him to my home and be his nurse instead of trying to work with the social worker to find housing for him?","This type of cancer is very aggressive and has a low success rate. Given his age, quality of life and this disease im sure your doctor did the right suggestion of sending him to hospice. Sorry for your loss but don't beat yourself over it. Could we have done something more? Maybe ... but the end result wouldn't have changed.","How much does unstable housing affect a treatment plan?

I just went to the gynecologist for irregular bleeding. The gynecologist inserted a speculum without lubricant and two sticks. She didn’t tell me what this was for. I assume it’s a pap smear but I don’t even know; she didn’t tell me a single thing. The stick was covered from bottom to top with blood. I thought that with a pap smear it was only supposed to be bloody where it touches the back of you. She threw the speculum into the sink, not placed. I asked what she was doing before she put it in and she didn’t reply other than “it’ll hurt”. 

She then stuck 1-2 fingers inside of me (without warning) and kept pressing on my stomach while wiggling her fingers and I was screaming and crying out because it hurt so bad. She just ripped her fingers out when she was done (not gently at all) and told me there’s blood go pee and then she walked out and left.

She’s aware that I was sexually assaulted numerous times by my abuser and that I have massive trauma. She also knows that the only “exam” I’ve ever had was a rape kit at the hospital, and have never have one done at a gynecologist. 

I’ve been crying for over an hour. Is this normal? I never want to go to the gynecologist again. I feel so god damn violated. She inserted 4 things so roughly and ignored my questions. She didn’t even tell me the procedure name that she was doing.","I agree that this was incredibly inappropriate and unprofessional.

So I’ve been taking antibiotics for a suspected ear infection for 6 days now. I have had diarrhea before I started taking them and have continued to have it to today. Most of the time is yellow mucus. I figured it must be going on this long due to the amoxicillin. 

Today I finally had a solid stool and there was a small patch that was dark red and white thready substance in different areas. Almost looked fuzzy like mold. Unfortunately I don’t have a picture. 

About 4ish hours later I had solid stools again but this time there appears to be actual worms however I’d like to get a second opinion from you doctors. I have an appointment tomorrow with my doctor but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to get your opinions.

48083,Sprained ankle not getting better,"38F, 5'2"", 190lbs. At the end of July, I was at the gym doing box steps when my right ankle rolled under me and I went down. I felt a pop in my ankle and was in pain, so I went to the er. They did x-rays and they didn't see a break, so they said it was probably a sprain but to follow up with my PCP in 2 weeks. They put me in a walking boot because I work on my feet a lot. I don't have a PCP, so a few weeks later, it was still painful and super swollen (though I was able to fit it in a shoe again), so I went to urgent care for my follow up. They suggested keeping it wrapped in an ace bandage and continuing to ice it and, if it wasn't better in a couple weeks, to come back and get an MRI.

3 weeks later, it's still hurting a bit but I moved into a new apartment with a lot of stairs and noticed it was more painful and more swollen. So I went back to urgent care, who sent me for an MRI. (At this point, it's been about 6 weeks since  After getting it done, the tech asked me if I remembered doing anything to it, but said he wasn't allowed to say if he saw anything. The next day, the urgent care doctor calls and tells me I've got several torn ligaments and I need to go see an orthopedic. I find one on my insurance and go in to see him. They look at the MRI and do another set of X-rays, then the doctor comes in. He straight up laughs and says there's nothing wrong with my ankle. I asked him about what the urgent care doc said and he replied that ""that's what a sprain is, it's torn ligaments"". He said he could give me a brace if it would make me feel better, but I didn't need it.

So now, besides feeling like an idiot for basically being told nothing was wrong and I needed to suck it up, I don't know what to do. I don't want to go back to the doctor just to get laughed at again, but it's been 2 1/2 months and my ankle (up into the front of my shin)  is still hurting and constantly swollen.

How often should I wake her during the night to check her temperature? I'm getting in a pulse oximeter tomorrow, but as I tested negative for covid, I'm not in the same room as her to check for myself. What do I do to keep her healthy?

34170,What mental illness does this sound like? Any advice or anybody who could relate would be greatly appreciated,"Sorry in advance for grammar mistakes, English is not my first language. 

I am an 18 year old 5'11, 135 pound Caucasian male with asthma, allergies, post concussion syndrome, neck issues and anxiety. 

So ive been dealing with this mental condition/state for just over a year now, probably caused by a bad brain injury i sustained. I have been diagnosed by different doctors with having GAD, ocd, depression and panic attacks. I wanted to make this post to see if anyone could relate or offer any kind of advice, it would be very appreciated as i am really really struggling so bad right now. 

Its really hard to describe and i have searched the internet trying to find someone who is experiencing something similar but to no avail. I basically have this horrible recurring feeling that overtakes my whole body where i feel intensely disturbed, like im living in some kind of twisted horror film or psychotic weird music video or something likr that. It sort of feels like some kind of weird fever dream. Everything sort of out of the ordinary or that my brain deems to be twisted or imperfect in any way just intensifies this awful weird feeling. Sometimes it can be so intense it literally overtakes my whole body and leaves me almost petrified, hardly able to move or talk and its accompanied by intense feelings of complete despair and like nothing at all in the world is ok or will ever be ok. I have to close my eyes and focus on my breathing cause everything i look at will intensify this feeling in my chest and throat. I cant do or think of anything cause it all makes it worse and increases this horrible, disgusting, vile feeling inside me. Its not that nothing inspires me or brings me any joy, its that doing anything 'normal' other then laying in my bed and watching a set of 'safe' videos is complete agony and makes me feel awful. 

Its really hard to describe and sometimes im convinced im going psychotic even though im fully lucid, able to control myself and no one in my life has noticed any crazy person behaviour at all. I also feel extremely foggy inside my head as well as like detached and disconnect from myself and the world, like im watching everything, even my own thoughts, through this kind of foggy mirror. My brain is also just in this weird state, for instance i will be unable to visualize things or make 'mental images' or do anything cognitive really at all, especially when this feeling is really roaring inside of me. Physically ill feel this weird nauseous sick sensation and like i have molasses coursing through my body that makes me feels slow and heavy. 

Weird or scary movies, music or books as well as 'disturbing' material in school is agonizing for me and can really set me off into terrible episodes. These are just some examples of the many things that will bother me. 

I have a bunch of other issues but i wont bring them up as they are much more easily identifiable as gad, depression or ocd related so they don't scare me as much. I also have panic attacks on occasion although much less frequently as i did before. 

It all started in like September of 2017 and was extremely intense for around 6-7 months, so bad i had to take a medical leave of absence from school and i could barely function at all on my own. I would also experience horrible nausea and sick feelings so bad i could barely move and would barely eat for day. However, it then started to get better after a while and i felt much more like myself and this 'disturbed' feeling was way less intense. I still struggled with mental illness but it was much more ocd, depression related. The worst is the brain fog although i know that could be injury related as well as mental health. 

However, lately these feelings and more have come back full force. I have identified 3 events that could potentially have been the trigger.

 1. I suffered extreme emotional trauma when i went through a breakup a couple months ago with my long term girlfriend who was my world and by far my biggest support system. Im still really emotionally affected by this and it causes this feeling in my gut of complete and utter despair so intense i can barely move, its not even sadness its more just terror and agony.

 2. I just started at a new school in fashion marketing and everything is obviously new and different for me and the stress is elavated since i obviously have more work now. My brain takes this as 'disturbing' and now, not even three weeks into the semester, my brain already associates my school and campus with this disturbing terrible feeling which is really bad and i desperately hope i can chance this association. This is really hard without my gf to support me talk things through with, i genuinely believe if i still had her the transition to this college would be much much smoother and i may even be improving now. 

 3. The weather. Summer is ending and giving way to cold temperatures, darkness and grey sky's. I have a terrible sub conscious association with the feeling of fall and winter arriving since it is when my worst incidents and rough patches were when this whole thing started last year. The seasons changing is bringing back so many dark feelings and memories that are just so terrifying. As silly as it sounds i really think the changing weather is huge for perpetuating and causing this awful feelings and symptoms to come back.

I feel like the world around me is just moving too fast and i am completely losing it, im completely outside of myself and my body and have no idea whats happening or whats going on, the only reason i am able to function some days is because of muscle memory. It is absolutely terrifying, i think i read something online that said it could be like 'depersonalisation' or something like that. 

Yah so that's it, i understand my post is very long and probably no one will read it but if anyone does, i would appreciate it so much, this is the hardest patch of my life and the hardest thing ive ever had to go through. Im 18 and i really dont see any way this will get better or ill ever be able to have any kind of normal or happy life, i really dont, every day is so hard. And before anyone asks, i do have a therapist, i do cognitive behavioural therapy.

Edit: also, since this all started my sleep has been greatly affected and i believe it plays a significant role in compounding my issues. ","Seizure activity was my first thought too, /u/shepherdofthewolf.

Weight: 93kg
Gender: Male
Location: Europe
Primary complaint: Insomnia 

I’ve had insomnia now for a good 10 years (on and off). I’ve been doing it all: Melatonin supplements, Mindfulness medication, Sleep restriction Therapy, Doxylamine…but I just can’t seem to get a proper sleeping routine working. Needless to say that this affects my quality of life massively. 

Today, a doctor who’s a friend of mine advised me to seek a medication with a low dose of mirtazapine. 

Reading the possible side effects, I’m already scared of the reported massive weight gain that it’s said to bring. 

My questions are: 
- How many % of patients experience the weight gain? 

- I read somewhere that this side effect is dose dependent and that with lower doses, you don’t gain that much weight. Is that true?

Thanks!","In my experience, lower doses of mirtazapine uncommonly cause weight gain in my patients. Other physicians might have differing experiences. 

What I am more curious about is why you are having sleep difficulties. 

I would personally recommend an evaluation by a neurologist (preferably one that is sleep-trained, but not essential), along with a thorough list of your medications (current and past, and how long you have been taking them), caffeine intake (amount, frequency, and time of day), night time activities before bed (any electronics usage, exposure to blue light on your devices, etc.), how much sleep you actually get (what time do you go to bed, how often do you wake up, what time do you actually get out of bed), whether you feel rested or tired when you wake up, presence of snoring or morning headaches, and whether you have had a sleep study in the past.","A befriended doctor advised me to take 7.5mg of mirtazapine for my insomnia - now I’m scared of gaining weight

- I read somewhere that this side effect is dose dependent and that with lower doses, you don’t gain that much weight. Is that true?

Thanks!","Answer: Weight gain is a potential side effect of mirtazapine, but the exact percentage of patients experiencing it varies. Studies suggest that around 10-20% of patients may experience weight gain, and it's generally dose-dependent, with higher doses increasing the risk.

33571,Why did my blood pressure spike during surgery?,"Hi all. I've got a bit of a interesting/complicated story here and English is not my primary language but I'll try my best to explain.

I am a 21 year old male. I am 189 cm (6'2"") in height and I currently weigh 105 kgs (231 lbs). 2 years ago I had a surgery for a pilonidal cyst near my tailbone. The doctor said it was a pretty easy, 1 hour surgery that had only very low risks. Unfortunately the surgery didn't exactly turn out that way. Apparently during surgery my blood pressure went up to 20's, my skin went red and I had rashes due to an allergic reaction to the sheets they had in the operating room (?) and the surgery went on to be 2 hours (it was under general anesthesia by the way). They told me the blood pressure thing was probably due to a side effect/allergies to the anesthesia drugs.

But the thing is, at the time I was gaining weight and I weighed 140 kgs (308 lbs). Before surgeries you obviously fill out a form where they ask for stuff like height, weight, medications, allergies etc. I was so embarassed about my weight that I did the extremely stupid mistake of lying about my weight and I filled the form as if I was 120 kg (264 lbs) when I was actually 140 kgs.

But there's also a second thing that I should probably give the information of; I have white coat hypertension. I get pretty nervous at doctors visits and since years, whenever my blood pressure is checked in a clinic it reads at 14-16. I went to a cardiologist check-up few weeks ago for this issue, the doctor ran a blood test, echo, EKG, EKG on a treadmill and a 24 hour holter monitor test. It all turned out to be clean and he confirmed it was white coat hypertension.

So, my question is; did the blood pressure spike happen due to me lying about my weight which may have caused something like, I don't know, maybe the dosage of my anesthesia drugs were miscalculated? Did it happen due to white coat hypertension? Or was it actually allergies since I did seem to have an allergic reaction of some sort due to my skin going red and rashes and whatnot?

[

My dad is 70, in generally good health, 5'3"", about 130lbs. He has had this thing for about 7 years from what I can recall. The tumor (in case you did not see the image) is below his hairline on the back of his left side of the neck, and below his ear. He eats pretty healthy and does not do much exercise but walk to do his errands once every few days.

I am not sure what the terminology is, but the tumor is not harmful - it isn't cancerous or anything that would harm him if he keeps it and does not have it removed. The thing is, he is 70. Besides the fact that it isn't unheard of that medical procedures mess up - there is also the aspect of anti-biotics. He has had a history of heart issues (pericarditis) and I don't know if he mentioned that to the doctor that he spoke with. He is keen on doing it because he is self-conscious of the aesthetic aspect (which I totally understand - it's not pretty and I'm sure it bothers him). It could be that I am wrong and removing this tumor would actually be healthy for him because the tumor (heaven forbid) might cause harm in the future.

For the record - I am not asking for any medical advice here. He has seen doctors and is on the path to getting this thing removed.

My dad is 70, in generally good health, 5'3"", about 130lbs. He has had this thing for about 7 years from what I can recall. The tumor (in case you did not see the image) is below his hairline on the back of his left side of the neck, and below his ear. He eats pretty healthy and does not do much exercise but walk to do his errands once every few days.

I am not sure what the terminology is, but the tumor is not harmful - it isn't cancerous or anything that would harm him if he keeps it and does not have it removed. The thing is, he is 70. Besides the fact that it isn't unheard of that medical procedures mess up - there is also the aspect of anti-biotics. He has had a history of heart issues (pericarditis) and I don't know if he mentioned that to the doctor that he spoke with. He is keen on doing it because he is self-conscious of the aesthetic aspect (which I totally understand - it's not pretty and I'm sure it bothers him). It could be that I am wrong and removing this tumor would actually be healthy for him because the tumor (heaven forbid) might cause harm in the future.

For the record - I am not asking for any medical advice here. He has seen doctors and is on the path to getting this thing removed. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, thank you.","Answer: It's understandable that you're concerned about your dad's decision, but it seems he's already on the path to consulting with doctors and considering the procedure.

Medication: 2 Nexium a day and Wellbutrin (37.5mg)


Hi all,

I’ve suffered with GERD for 3 years now. Few minor flare ups and 1 that sent me to the ER (2016).

I managed to keep my reflux at bay but recently, it’s been the worst I’ve ever had. 

The past 4 weeks, I’ve had 3 major “flare ups” to the point where I’m throwing up and cannot stand up straight due to the sharp pain in my chest and back. It’s the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. I always want to call a medic when it happens but last time I did that, the ER doc said, you just have GERD.

So after I puke for about an hour, the pain settles down. I sweat and shake during this and then I have chills down the rest of the day/night.

The pain is so bad that I see double and feel as if I’m about to pass out from the pain. 

I sip on baking soda and water and that helps a little but not much. I’ve tried Mylanta, Rolaids, Tums, you name it. Nothing helps.

I had the worst episode yet as of tonight. I can’t get the pain to go away.  I don’t know what to do anymore.

How do I make this go away? My previous doctor suggested I take 2 nexium and have a bland diet. I’ve worked on my diet and I know I’m overweight. Why am I getting this severe pain all of the sudden?

Thanks for listening and your help.","Have you ever had an endoscopy / OGD?  You're already on a PPI + over the counter antacids which are the 'standard' treatments.  I'd be thinking about gastritis, possible hiatus hernia , H. pylori as part of my diagnostic workup.","GERD has gotten out of hand.

Hello I have been feeling this popping sensation in my foot or knee cant tell. Also have a hip that pops but doesnt hurt during the act of raising it and lowering is when it pops only while lowering it and you can hear it to not just me but others hear it.  My hip on hurts in general sometimes switches sides more often of left side. Knee used to hurt only when i rose my knee while sitting down on the left side it would hurt still does when i do it sometimes it hurts freaking bad then sometimes it doesnt. 

I also have overlapping toes and one of my toes steps on the other like all the time could be causing me to feel popping and pulsing feeling?

My ankle hip calf and shin have been hurting some parts hurt some times then moves to another spot and then some moves to another spot ankle pops when moving it sometimes up and down

I was wearing the same pair of shoes every day for years sense like 2013 even at gym and they were worn think i could have injured my self i also leg press 450 lbs and becn press 160 or used too havent for like 3 - 4 months sense these sensations started

I have a tingly leg or foot sensation on the left side like nerves jumping up and down feeling

one day when benching i put wrong weights on one side and heard my back crack also have back pains middle left side back upper middle i do sit 8+ hours a day for work though also a long long time ago i leg pressed and my knee popped and it hurt for a second. you can see divit or something on my left knee in images it hurts when i press it not too bad but a little

i also get jaw pains on my left side every now and then

i have visible neck pulsations onboth sides of my neck doctors say its normal at least GP though going to cardiologist monday worried i have DVT though Iliotibial band syndrome caused by wearing worn shoes or something else caused by that

i hate the tingly and pulsations feelings in my foot the most some people on reddit think i have scatica but pain comes and goes not always there

i get headaches a lot am on computer like 8 hours a day tho

before all this started i was working out at gym 2 hours a day every day 1 hour cardio and same weights every day i also never did any stretching which i regret if thats what causes what im feeling 

as for jaw in headaches i think that could be caused by me not wearing my reatainers anymore and formerly had herbst appliance and braces

i have cold feet and hands often but family has renauds phenonom 

sometime foot feels like clicking pulsing feeling on left side look at left foot and knee closely please does it look fine

sorry for mess of typing typed fast so i could get 7 hours of sleep b4 work

The shortness of breath is there about 70% of the day, it's not constant but sometimes if I walk too long, walk up the stairs to my office, or even when I'm just sitting watching tv, I'll find myself out of breath. I'm 170cm tall and (over 60kg) about 130lbs, and 29M. I used to exercise but had to stop because of my fatigue, always feeling physically and mentally weary.

I wasn't satisfied with this answer and after feeling sick for another week, I went back to the ER complaining about breathlessness. They tested me for covid and gave me an x-ray. Covid negative and they said x-ray was fine.

My family dr had me follow up with a specialist over the ct results, and I had to do this test where I blew hard into this device. She said I have a lung age of 29, but took a look at the xray and said I had scarring and it was concerning but she could not give me a diagnosis and asked me to make an appointment with my Dr. 

My question is, do you think I have pulmonary fibrosis? I have GERD, could this have just been the reason for my scarring? Is there anything else this could be? I'm going crazy over thinking I will be diagnosed with IPF and have 3 years to live, getting lung transplant etc.

Height - 5'8""

Weight - 151

Race - White

Duration of complaint - Month and a half+

Location (Geographic and on body) - Neck, collarbone, head

For the past month and a half or so I've noticed a hard line on the right side of my neck which goes from my right collar bone to right behind the ear. I think it's a muscle, because I'm not sure what else it would be. It is close to rock hard, but it bends when I tilt my head to the side and doesn't really hurt.

The bump on my collarbone is definitely not supposed to be there. It feels like the rest of my collarbone but is about an inch to the right of furthest inner point on my right collarbone. As far as I can tell, the hard muscle thing is connected to it. 

I can feel the hard muscle right behind the bump if I am standing up straight. Turning my head to the left causes the muscle to kind of pass over the bump and all I can fee is the muscle. If I turn my head to the right the muscle ""retracts"" and I can only feel the bump.

Additionally, I've had intermittent pains in my right temple and the corners of my jaws, which are exponentially completely unrelated. Since yesterday it feels like I have the start of an ear ache as my ear feels slightly clogged. Additionally, for about as long as I've noticed the neck muscle thing, I've had a small bump right in front of my ear. My doctor is fairly sure it is a lymph node, but he isn't particularly worried about it.

I only noticed the bump on my collarbone last night, and have scheduled an appointment with my doctor to look at it, but I figure having more information is always helpful.","Could it be the sternocleidomastoid muscle?

For pretty much all of my life, I had always been naturally extremely motivated, happy and social.  (Also a relatively high libido)

First experienced large drop in libido coupled with ED, no other issues

--Mid-April:
Started also experiencing occasional waves of mood swings/depression and lack of interest in life

--Mid-May:
Began to experience (1) even stronger ED and libido loss.  (2) Extreme depression for 30-90 minutes every day.  (3) Also began noticing fuzzy thought (can't think clearly) and (4) lack of motivation and interest even outside depressive episodes.

--Late May:
Began to also experience loss in appetite



Normally I have an endless desire to learn new things, meet new people, and stay physically active.  I'm constantly out of the house at social events and playing sports, and when I am home I read books and research random thought-provoking topics endlessly.  Whatever is happening has ended my desire to be social, and also my interest in reading has dropped to nearly zero which is deeply concerning.  Some of my issues have been noticed by my family and is straining numerous relationships.

I've had two blood tests done to identify any deficiencies, with no success.  All results indicated that I had normal levels of almost everything, including TSH (I suspected thyroid issues may be the cause).  I also suspected low testosterone, but it turns out I actually have slightly above average levels.

I couldn't find much on Google, and I now suspect there is some hormone I haven't yet tested which is causing this.  If not, perhaps some unexplained issues with neurotransmitters?  Really hoping this isn't the case, but maybe even a brain tumor (really crossing my fingers this isn't it)

9728,5 yr old got cast off broken arm today - reassure me this is normal?,"Hi!  I would really appreciate some opinions/reassurance on this.

My five year old fell on the monkey bars at school last month.  We went to the ER, they did X-rays, said he broke his ulna.  He was complaining of pain along the radius, but they said it was the ulna.  Put a splint on, made an appointment in two days with the pediatric ortho.

My husband took him to that appointment and they re-did the x-rays and said he had a monteggia fracture - the radius was also broken up by the elbow joint. From what I'd read I was worried about surgery, but doc said he just needed 4 weeks in a cast.

We got the cast off this morning, and there are a couple of big out of place bumps and it doesn't straighten all the way.  Just looking at it, waiting for them to take new x-rays, I was concerned it wasn't right.  Anyway, doc came in, looked over the x-rays and said its healing great.  That you can see the new bone forming in the straight ""path of least resistance"" areas and that over time the broken bone that's sticking out will reduce and look more normal as he grows.  

He put a wrist support brace on him and told us to come back in two weeks to see if we need PT.

I just... I'm shocked that his arm looks so deformed and is considered ""healed"" and while it makes sense about the new bone forming on the x-rays... they just look awful to me.  Would love to hear someone else confirm that this is to be expected.

Here's the link with pictures of his arm and pictures of the x-rays from today as well as the original one from the ER.  I don't have the first set the ortho took.

1430,"21 Year Old Male, 205 lbs, 5’10” - Potential lisfranc fracture","Hello everyone,

About 2 weeks ago I was playing soccer and landed on my toes and heard several cracks. My foot swelled up a decent amount with bruises occurring by my heel and at the very beginning of all my toes. After elevating my foot and icing it for these past 2 weeks the swelling is almost completely gone, no more bruising, and my foot doesn’t hurt anymore. Also, there was no bruising on the bottom of my foot (which I understand to be a clear sign of a fracture).

Went to a podiatrist today and he took x rays and said that there are some irregularities in the bones on my left foot, so he ordered an MRI. He tested all the motions of my foot and I could do them all without any pain at all. 

However, around my 5th metatarsal there is very slight pain (a little less pain than if you were to press against a bruise). 

He then told me to keep doing what I was doing (icing and elevating, as well as staying off the foot completely) until I have the MRI.

","It's hard to interpret a spot urine creatinine with no volume. Excretion of waste, including creatinine, is a primary kidney function. You should excrete a lot of creatinine. In healthy kidneys the amount excreted depends on the amount present (which itself depends mostly on muscle mass) and how much urine you produce; if you drink a lot of fluid and produce lots of urine, it will be more dilute, and if you drink little fluid on a hot day you'll produce very concentrated urine, but overall the same amount of total creatinine excreted.

Medications: Currently on Prednisone oral (was on high dose IV starting four days ago, 23-25 June)

I had a lumbar puncture 5 days ago, 22nd of June, Friday. Since then I've been having trouble sitting and standing; when I do, my head feels very wobbly, I have to focus to stay balanced, and the back of my head feel heavy. A headache also starts to onset, and my neck feels stiff.

Thankfully my headaches are not as severe as what I've read of others online, but they are bad enough that I eventually feel like puking. Lying down alleviates the symptoms and I feel better, except for my back aching from lying down too much, and some residual discomfort. While I'm thankful it's not getting worse, it shows no signs of getting better either.

My worry is if I should be going to the hospital to get it checked out? My friend mentioned I may have a small CSF leak at the LP area, and that has me concerned. I've never had a lp before, and I don't know what to expect. Is this something that I can just simply rest off? Or should I see a doctor asap?

My ear has been ringing for 2 days straight and it's driving me crazy.  This has actually happened to me once or twice in the past.  The other times it has just stopped ringing randomly after about 2 days, so I'm hoping it stops on its own today.  I did some googling and some sources said ringing in your ear could be a sign of a more serious health issue.  I'm assuming website just throw that in there to protect themselves, but figured I'd ask reddit.

I was just sitting up in my bed when it started ringing, wasn't moving or doing anything significant.  It also felt very clogged, almost like that ear was underwater.  Yesterday I had my wife put hydrogen peroxide in my ear to clear it out...that actually helped.  Now it doesn't feel clogged, but the ringing persists.

Thoughts?","Go to a doctor/urgent care. Have them look in your ears. If it's chock full of wax, have them attempt removal and see if that helps. If they can't clear it OR if the ear looks clear, go see an ENT ASAP. When you call the ENT on Monday (or Tuesday if you're in the US, since most will be closed Mon), tell them you have sudden, single-sided ringing and hearing loss and they should work you in within a day or two.

If the PCP/Urgent care tells you ""you have a little fluid,"" don't accept that answer. They know a lot, but they aren't always great at looking in ears. It's not their fault - it's hard and takes a lot of practice that they don't get.

I'm happy to see you if you're in Atlanta.

(The reason for the urgency is that sudden single-sided ringing can indicate a sudden sensorineural hearing loss, which needs to be treated ASAP, preferably within a few days of onset, or else you risk permanent ringing/hearing loss).","My left ear has been ringing for 2 days straight...should I go to a doctor?

Have them look in your ears. If it's chock full of wax, have them attempt removal and see if that helps. If they can't clear it OR if the ear looks clear, go see an ENT ASAP. When you call the ENT on Monday (or Tuesday if you're in the US, since most will be closed Mon), tell them you have sudden, single-sided ringing and hearing loss and they should work you in within a day or two. If the PCP/Urgent care tells you ""you have a little fluid,"" don't accept that answer. They know a lot, but they aren't always great at looking in ears.

Im in a shitty situation, I started to realize when I weighed 250 at 13 years old that maybe I could have some issue, i havent talked to anyone about it because im nervous. At this point It may be other things making me eat so much, would I say im depressed? No, im not sure but I can sure as hell tell you that I have been sad 24/7 for the past 6 years non stop and suicide has crossed my mind many times. But should I honestly get real help?

I'm not sure about all that (though it can feel daunting going through the schooling and training), but I can definitely echo the sentiment that they're there to help. Especially at your age, your pediatrician is invested in giving you the tools you will need to become a healthy adult. If you need the help, just ask! Hopping on my pediatrician soapbox for a second: concerning your comments about feeling sad a lot, you should know that it is very common to feel sad or even depressed and anxious. These feelings can certainly contribute to you feeling unwell. The brain is very powerful, and can affect your body in lots of ways (when I feel stressed or anxious, I literally feel sick to my stomach). If these feelings ever, EVER make you feel as though you may harm yourself or others, please, please, PLEASE talk to your parents, your doctor, or call one of the “hotlines” that are out there to seek help. The very last thing I (or anyone) would want is for you to feel so badly that it puts you or others at risk.

Issues: Has been going on for about a week

So to start off to give some of my background information. I do have gastritis, IBS, along with a long list of other issues involving my stomach and intestines. So I’ve always had really weird poops and issues that involve me pooping. Once I need to poop I typically only have a matter of minutes before I need to get to the toilet sometimes even less than a minute, partly due to my low muscle tone, making it hard for me to hold it. I typically also get sharp pains in my lower stomach area and sides right before I need to go poop. Also my poops and farts typically smell really bad.

But lately Around the time when the cramping and pain sets in before I need to go to the bathroom, I can typically smell the really bad smell my poop,  But the weird thing is I haven’t farted yet. So is it weird that I can smell my poop before I poop and without farting. The poop has also been very very dark , still brown not black. It also feels kind of acidy on the way outI also have been hospitalized a few times because of internal bleeding in my intestines, but like said my poop is dark brown not black or red so I don’t think it’s that. Any advice would be helpful thanks. 
🙏🙏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏽🙏🏾🙏🏿 💩😷","Honestly just sounds like bad IBS.  Smelling your poop means it’s coming out as gas from below (it has no other way of exiting), probably without you knowing.  If you have low muscle tone, that could be why.  

I agree with you, it doesn’t sound like a GI bleed.  

I’m assuming you’ve been scoped at some point?  Anyone with long-standing symptoms that aren’t getting better usually needs a more thorough look.

SORRY! I MEANT 400 ug !!! NOT milligrams that's nuts!

'm (20F) 5'8.5, 150lbs. Vegan, never drink, quit nicotine about a month ago when I found out I was pregnant. No known health problems. History of high blood pressure on my fathers side. Had my last check up 6 months ago. I'm not taking any medications but I am taking Ritual prenatal supplements daily and 400mg magnesium supplements every other day.


10 to 12 weeks pregnant (I get my ultrasound in 6 days, first visit with obgyn in 16)


I want to trip without smoking cigarettes so I can get over my attachment to them but I don't know if that's safe? I know exposing your body to practically anything while pregnant is bad for your baby 


but is acid sort of like alcohol ? Where if you expose yourself once to it in your first trimester it wont do much of anything? Or is it like MDMA where it can straight up cause a miscarriage after one use?


I am not looking for cookie cutter opinions on how all criminalized drugs are bad and will make your brain bad and your body bad and your friends bad or whatever


I'm looking to know specifically this dosages effect on a 1st trimester baby in my specific body and I dont know if I'm comfortable talking about felony weight drugs with an irl doctor 


I'd really appreciate a response! Thank you ♡

Edit: whoops! I thought mg was micrograms","So we don’t actually know if there is a safe level of alcohol for pregnant mothers to drink. We know alcohol causes birth defects, we also know that sometimes women who drink a little (think a glass of wine or a sip of champagne) before they know they are pregnant have OK outcomes- we don’t know what the limit is, if there is a limit (ie, is every fetus different?) etc. so we say no drinking, because the risk (FAS) is definitely there no matter what stage or how much you drink. It is not safe to drink alcohol while pregnant because we don’t know if there is a safe amount or what that safe amount is and it’s unethical to experiment. 

As for LSD... in rats it can cause miscarriage, and it has been shown to reduce blood flow in the placenta. It also sticks around in the placenta, which is a risk for mom, because placentas can and sometimes are tested for illegal substances after birth, which can be used to report mom to CPS. There are limited old studies showing eye damage to the fetus when mom takes LSD. It also has a statistically significant chance of causing chromosome damage to the fetus, which is a grab bag of effects. There is also a chance it does nothing. Some moms have done LSD before they knew or while they were pregnant and had normal babies. 

Ultimately, like alcohol, we know it can cause problems, but there isn’t a way to know where the line can be drawn. If you were sitting in my clinic, I’d say if you took LSD before you knew, wait to panic. If you’re considering taking it now, I’d advise you not to, since the effects in rats can be bad and again... we don’t know the line in the sand. So better safe than sorry. 

This is unfortunately the answer for a lot of things in pregnancy!

And no judgement. I used to work harm reduction and needle exchange/outreach. I get it- life is complicated, your story is complicated, and there isn’t any good to come from a “DRUGS BAD” or “DRUGS GOOD” position.","Would it be safe for me to consume 400 mg of LSD while pregnant?

25331,"[18F, Ireland] I was SA'd when I was around 10, causing me to almost claim my own life at the age of 14/15. It was sorted out by CPS. Would my doctor be forced to report it if I told her?","Sorry for the throwaway, I don't want this to be associated with my main reddit due to friends knowing my account. 

As stated above, I was treated horribly by a close family member who was only a few years older than me. To say the least, he touched me in my intimate areas because he, himself was curious about sex. When I told my parents, they lectured him and split us away. Later on, he started to manipulate me into doing it again, but this time I did not tell my parents as I felt responsible. Now, I know that I was a child and could not consent. I also know that I did not understand what was going on and how it was bad. This only lasted a few months give-or-take until I was able to understand the situation. 

 A lot of guilt follows me to this day. I went to a counselor when I was around 14/15 years old after I thought of and wanted to go along with overdosing. I did not tell her about the second instance of SA in my life but I told her about the first time. She contacted CPS and told me to tell my doctor. Like an idiot, I did not tell my doctor anything but sorted out the situation with CPS. I stopped seeing the counsellor shortly after because of the stress induced by the situation. 

My mom did not want me to tell my doctor, and I could understand why. We didn't know if my doctor would further push the CPS situation or call the police on the person involved. I do not want to ruin his life so I kept my mouth shut. 

Now, I am an adult and finishing my last year of school. I really want to go to my doctor and tell her what happened because I feel like I may have developed some mental issues over the past few years due to my guilt and trauma. (I have dreams every now and then and think about the SA almost every day, am scared of men, and have attachment issues that may or may not be related to the SA).

My only fear is that this situation may blow up again and I may have to sort out CPS stuff. I am now quite close with the person who assaulted me. I forgive him and trust him, though I will never forget the thing he has done to me. He did not know about CPS the first time, but I'm afraid that if it gets reported again, he will realise this time. 

I'm so sorry for the post being scattered. I probably missed some details but my mental state has slowly started deteriorating again and I just need help now. 

Please, please, please tell me. I cannot deal with the moral battle in my head. Would my doctor have to report the situation again or could she keep it between us? Also would I have to reveal the name of the assaulter?  Also to add, I am **not** currently suicidal.","I'm in Canada, but most child protection laws are similar around the world. If a doc from Ireland comments, their advice may be more relevant for you; although hopefully I can help.

As you mentioned, you're an adult now. Under the law, adults are able to determine for themselves what the right course of action is. Mandatory reporting exists for children because they are powerless in a situation, and at times cannot speak for themselves. But as an adult now, you would fall outside the mandatory reporting laws and outside the child protection system. Your doctor must keep your confidentiality above all else, and cannot go report to the police or child protection on your behalf without your permission in cases of past trauma.

And it sounds like this situation was in the past, so there would be no grounds for your doctor to break confidentiality. Even if it was ongoing, as an adult, it's your choice what to do about the situation. As an example, there are lots of adults who experience domestic violence at home. And while we worry about our patients and their safety, that's their choice and we can't override confidentiality to talk to the police. That's wrong for a number of reasons. So we support them and try to mitigate risk in the interim.

All this to say, you should 100% be able to bring up these concerns with your doctor. You can start the conversation and simply say, ""What is your policy on confidentiality and mandatory reporting?"" (adding, if you like, ""I have some trauma in my past that is hard to talk about"" or something to that effect if you feel safe to do so). Ideally this way, your doc can go over local rules and then you can disclose what you choose, in a timeline you choose, and in the detail you choose. You're in control this way.

I think you're past the point that child protection would have to be involved, and past the point of mandatory reporting for previously experienced trauma. You should never, ever, have to speak your assaulter's name if you do not want to. This is your story, your life - not theirs.

So if you feel safe to do so, definitely make an appointment with your doctor to go over this stuff. Like most humans, not all docs are trauma-informed, so if you do find that talking to this doctor isn't the right person to talk about this with, ask for a referral to a specialist who has experience with adverse childhood experiences / child trauma. If you aren't getting anywhere, some google sleuthing for doctor reviews may help you find the name of someone who could help, or sometimes different community groups have professionals they recommend.","[18F, Ireland] I was SA'd when I was around 10, causing me to almost claim my own life at the age of 14/15.

It's been a little over a month since I had a Myasthenic Crisis and was hospitalized in the ICU. I had three days of high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis for 5 days. I was feeling better respiratory-wise but still felt very tired and not back to 100% of where I was before the crisis.  I was put on Cellcept by my neuro immediately after release and so far it has made me have less droopy eyes and mouth but I haven't noticed much difference. 

( Note: I have been diagnosed since late 2019 and on Mestonin, they did not put me on other meds since I responded well at the time. It has since been suggested that the mestonin alone was no longer able to handle the disease and that is why I went into a myasthenic crisis)

The past week I have felt the shortness of breath from the Myasthenia come back, and at times I have gone on my CPAP to help reduce the strain and it has made me feel better. I'm starting to feel fatigued again, but not at myasthenic crisis level, so I'm pretty sure the benefits of plasmapheresis wore off.  My main concerns are:

Is it normal to take a while to recover from a Myasthenic Crisis?

Is the reemergence of shortness of breath a troubling symptom?

Should I ask my neuro for another treatment or medication? ( I was warned it could take 2-6 months for CellCept to fully work)

&#x200B;

I do see my neuro early next week, but I'm not sure if these symptoms are troubling enough I should seek medical care sooner or if there are other suggestions I should bring up to my doctor when I see her.","Yes you really need to contact your neuro doc.

Hi,

I had an MRI done around christmas after complaining of mild, nearly constant headaches. I don't have the report to double check but thankfully nothing terrible was found. I was diagnosed with chronic tension headaches and prescribed 10mg amitriptyline daily which I have found helps quite a bit though I still have them occasionally. The neurologist suggested I pursue a much earlier diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (\~6 years ago) which I had essentially forgotten about as CPAP did not make me feel better at all.

I was honestly a little skeptical of the findings of that sleep study as it showed really significant O2 desats <80% and I am quite skinny and don't snore. But I have now been scheduled for a second sleep study to confirm it.

That spurred me on to have a second look at the MRI disc that I was given. I've also been reading about all the things that could link OSA and headaches which brought up chiari malformation. Now by the looks of it there's no significant herniation of the cerebellar tonsils if any (though I can't really tell where exactly the edges of the foramen magnum are). It does look like the position of the odontoid process is a little further back than usual and I wonder if there's an effect due to the combination? My real question is, do you think the small line on the spinal cord is a syrinx or is that insignificant? Is it worth bringing this up (and bringing the MRI) at my next appointment?

Relevant medical issues : small inguinoscrotal hernia on my left side.

Lately I have been feeling a small lump on my left testicle, exactly on the bottom back side, maybe a little bit to the left. the first time i just let it be and i could no longer feel it after a few minutes or hours.  
Today i felt it again, it is still painless, but i am kinda worried.  
I did a scrotal ultrasound with doppler color a few weeks ago and it came back clear (mostly, cuz i had a small inguinoscrotal hernia on my left side.) with no masses on the testicle.

I am getting worried cuz it comes and goes and it might not have been there during the scan.

What could it be?

And I got concerned if that is my prostate? It kinda feel pretty enlarged if that is that. I am kinda freak out that it may be prostate cancer?

Does any one you have sensation like that? Is the prostate that close to the skin?

Also I want to state that I was diagnosed with small testicular varicose (someone said it may be just a cyst) 2 years ago.

And I kinda lost maybe half of my penile sensitivity in the past year. But I think that is from excessive masturbation without lotion.

I had escherichia coli 2 years ago. But In the last 3 tests I am negative.

I am smoke free for 2 years after smoking for 5 years. I drink regularly (2 times partying per week).

I don't have any other medical conditions as I know. I don't take any medications except light vitamin pills like vitamin C and B complex.

I am doing regular blood test 3 times a year and its pretty ok. I can post it here if you need.

In my family tree there aren't any more serious conditions except for diabetes maybe.

35652,Nuclear Scan....fixated on the risk,"Hi....so, 38/M and healthy had a lymph node scare last year.  Ultrasounds showed some slightly enlarged nodes, didn't go away but, kind of small to biopsy.  So, doctor suggested scans.  He said a CT would be appropriate but, if it showed something,  I'd end up back in for a PET/CT so, he decided to order the PET/CT all at once.  Being an ignorant patient, I knew nothing of the radiation risks.  Went through with the scan and it showed nothing which is great.  Now, 8 months later,  I cannot stop thinking about the scan and how I should have pushed back.  

I spoke with a radiation safety officer who estimated my dosage total to be ~19msv.  High.  Pretty damn high.   Up to this scan, I had never had any imaging outside of some MRIs and a few xrays for sports medicine stuff so pretty limited.  Now, I sit here 38 years old and wondering if I dammed myself to disease in the next decade because of a scan that likely could have been at best avoided or at worst, put off.

I know there is nothing I can do to take it back but,  any input here on the real risk from docs who prescribe scans?  There are so many studies linking anything over 10msv to significant additional risk but it still seems so unclear.   I am a very healthy person who has always tried to take my health seriously via diet, exercise and avoiding smoking, alcohol etc.  The fact I unknowingly did something with such a risk is literally driving me nuts.

Thanks!","That's... not high. For patients, there's no limit when it's medically necessary, and for occupationally-exposed people (like your nuclear medicine technologist who administered the 18F) 50 mSv is allowable in a year, as well as 20 mSv year averaged over 5 years. You got something on the order of 6 yrs of background radiation. A generally accepted figure is that 1000 mSv translates into a 5% excess risk of cancer death (on top of the natural incidence of cancer mortality of 25%), which might not even hold true at very low doses. So you're looking at *maybe* a 0.095% increase in cancer mortality over a lifetime, bringing ~25.000% to ~25.095%. 

That said, the PET wasn't really appropriate or necessary or very useful. But still nothing to freak out about.","Nuclear Scan....fixated on the risk

Hi....so, 38/M and healthy had a lymph node scare last year.  Ultrasounds showed some slightly enlarged nodes, didn't go away but, kind of small to biopsy.  So, doctor suggested scans.  He said a CT would be appropriate but, if it showed something,  I'd end up back in for a PET/CT so, he decided to order the PET/CT all at once.  Being an ignorant patient, I knew nothing of the radiation risks.  Went through with the scan and it showed nothing which is great.  Now, 8 months later,  I cannot stop thinking about the scan and how I should have pushed back.  

I spoke with a radiation safety officer who estimated my dosage total to be ~19msv.  High.  Pretty damn high.   Up to this scan, I had never had any imaging outside of some MRIs and a few xrays for sports medicine stuff so pretty limited.  Now, I sit here 38 years old and wondering if I dammed myself to disease in the next decade because of a scan that likely could have been at best avoided or at worst, put off.

I know there is nothing I can do to take it back but,  any input here on the real risk from docs who prescribe scans?  There are so many studies linking anything over 10msv to significant additional risk but it still seems so unclear.   I am a very healthy person who has always tried to take my health seriously via diet, exercise and avoiding smoking, alcohol etc.  The fact I unknowingly did something with such a risk is literally driving me nuts.

Thanks!","Answer: The risk of cancer from a single PET/CT scan is low, but not negligible, especially at a dose of 19 mSv. Studies suggest a 1-2% increased risk of cancer per 10 mSv, so your dose may be associated with a 2-4% increased risk.

First of all, I apologize if my formatting is incorrect I'm a first time poster and was told that I could receive some solid advice here.

So I finally went to the Dr. after multiple people commented on how much weight it looked like I lost. I never made a conscious decision to start losing weight, but some things in my lifestyle have changed - I began eating small salads for lunch (for budgetary reasons more than health), I changed my commute and do walk more than I used to, I stopped drinking coke, and, stupidly, began vaping nicotine. I had full blood work taken last Friday and was told that everything appeared normal on Monday morning, but my biggest concern is that I've read that pancreatic cancer can be undetected by blood tests in early stages. My doctor told me that if I drop below 160, then we would need to do a full body CT scan. I feel COMPLETELY normal. I have no loss of appetite and no fatigue or exhaustion. It's just troubling because the last time I weighed this much I was a freshman in high school. I don't know what kind of answer I'm looking for and now I'm concerned that I'm potentially masking a bigger problem by eating more just to maintain being above 160. Could it be that I just have lost this much weight naturally? I have always had a faster metabolism. Please, I'm just looking for some kind of reassurance as I've been a nervous wreck the last couple of days and worry that I'm spiraling into depression, which is ridiculous because thus far I've only received good news.

Confusion has been on and off for months, but gotten severe today

On Methadone and some other medications (that I do not know)

My cousin's wife (40s F, white, like 5'5, 200) is not mentally healthy normally. We all struggle with various mental health issues, but she's actively started worrying me today.

For background, she is a former drug addict (nearly 10 years sober) currently on methadone and some other medications for pain. I don't precisely know what her medicines are.

She doesn't sleep well most of the time and is often groggy and confused when she gets tired, but I've never seen her get as bad with the confusion as she just was. In the past hour, while entirely awake and alert sounding, she could not string two sentences together that made any sort of sense. For example, she started talking to me about this church with an ""upstairs church and downstairs church and there's this statue that cost 100k"" then she cut that off and starts talking about the boxes that we need to put away (having just moved). Then she says ""Kobe just died this weekend!"" (talking about Kobe Bryant, for some reason) and didn't believe me when I said he died years ago. Then she pulled her phone out to look it up and started showing me pictures of lighters and didn't remember talking about Kobe.

Earlier she called my cousin a ""lazy bastard"" then, 15 seconds later, said she didn't.

I don't know what is going on, but I'm concerned. Usually this is because she's tired and dreaming, but she's fully alert and not nodding off like she normally is.","I suspect it’s either all the drugs, or an infection causing confusion - or a mental health issue, hard to tell sorry","Cousin's Wife is confused and making no sense?

21478,Resting heart rate 169,"Hello everyone! I’m a 25 year old female, relatively active, mostly healthy my whole life. In October I caught COVID. Despite being vaccinated I did have some of the more serious symptoms, high fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pains, extremely lethargic etc. More than a month later I am still having shortness of breath, exhaustion, and a high heart rate. Resting I’ve been between 100-135 but last night I spiked to 169 at complete rest and stayed in the race of 140-165 for two hours. My doctor has ran an ekg, an X-ray of the lungs, and had me wear a Zio patch for 7 days (I just took it off and mailed that yesterday). My question here is: Are they doing all they can? Is there testing that could be done? And when is it appropriate to go to the ER for a fast heart rate? I do have a history of heart disease in my family. I have a friend who is an ER nurse and she’s concerned about a pulmonary embolism, but taking into account all the trauma she’s endured the last two years I’m wondering if she may just be thinking the extreme. Sorry for the long post, this is all just very scary as I have a toddler that needs his mommy around.","I can imagine that this is really distressing for you, sorry you're going through this on top of having had a bad case of COVID.

1. The tests that the doctor has run so far are all appropriate. The results of your Zio patch should come back in a few days, and it's good that you were wearing it during one of the episodes. The doctor will be able to let you know what the underlying rhythm you're having is, and will direct you to an appropriate course of action. This is the best/only way to figure out what's happening. Luckily, your family history of heart disease (assuming you mean coronary artery disease) is probably not relevant here since you're so young.
2. Go to the ER if you're feeling lightheaded, faint, nauseous, short of breath, or have chest pain during an episode. 
3. Did you get a D-dimer test or a troponin at any point? If your D-dimer was negative, pulmonary embolism was effectively ruled out. If not, and you're worried about PE/you have any other symptoms of it (pain when taking a deep breath, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, coughing up blood), definitely go to the ED to get checked out. A PE wouldn't have shown up on your chest X-ray.","Resting heart rate 169

27058,17/F Unquenchable thirst for the past year and a half with no other symptoms whatsoever.,"F/17/5'5/145lb
I have adhd. I take 36 MG Concerta during nonsummer months, since the summer of 2016.  I took 30-40 mg of Ritalin daily from 2008-2015 during nonsummer months. I take over-the-counter medicine max 3 times a year for a cold or an upset stomach. I have had a small handful of short lived illnesses in my life such as a stomach bug, a few fevers, and a minor sinus infection. As far as I know I have never experienced a headache, faintness, broken bone, mineral/vitamin deficiency, or dehydration.
 
I woke up thirsty one day in mid-December of 2016 (a year and a half ago), and ever since then I have had extreme and persistent thirst. Drinking water-no matter what amount-makes me even thirstier. I can usually 'tune out' the feeling, but the summer weather exacerbates it to the point of causing constant discomfort. I do not have symptoms of physical illness aside from thirst. 

The thirst began right in the middle of an 8-month period during which I was working out 6-10 hours a week, prepping  every meal in advance (except weekends) with good macro- and micro-nutrient ratios, and drinking 2-4 qts of water a day,  according to my thirst levels. I didn't experience fatigue, injury, sleep deprivation, or excessive weight fluctuation during this time. My doctor told me to eat less salt but I consistently generally consume the RDA of sodium. She did not know what else it could be. 

In June 2015, I started drinking a lot of water to ""cleanse"" with my friends. We all drank a lot during the month of June, but my friends went back to drinking normal amounts over the summer. I continued drinking lots of water. It didnt affect my bathroom habits very much, and it helped me feel full and eat less. Throughout the rest of 2015 and up till July of 2016, I drank an average of 1-3 gallons of water throughout each day. Looking back, it was ridiculous, but I went with the fad if you will. The intense thirst began 5 months later in December 2016.

I have had a dry mouth for about 4 years now, although it is mostly my tongue that feels dry. My tongue has always felt a bit too wide for my mouth, even at 6/7 yrs old; I have a slight  lisp on the letter s, z, j because my tongue sticks out to the left of my front incisors. I have never experienced any severe dry mouth symptoms though, and I take care of my oral hygiene so It is not very noticeable to me or those around me. 

I had a full mouth series done in April 2018. My teeth were the worst the dental hygienists at the college had ever seen. They look stellar on the outside but there are interior and exterior cavities in 3/4 of the teeth. Gums are also in bad shape. I generally neglected my teeth throughout childhood and some of my teenage years, and I have had 6 cavities, but I have had a brushing routine down for 2 years. I have eaten a diet of roughly 80% unprocessed food for my whole life. Everyone at the dental hygiene school was baffled. They and the dentist agreed that it was ~30% neglect in conjunction with ~70% other factors, mostly xerostomia, that caused the decay. 

I got a root canal in September of 2017, but doc didn't say anything about additional decay. He claims he did not see anything abnormal in the x-rays. The only lifestyle change 
between September 2017 and april 2018 is that I started drinking seltzer, which I know can be bad for the mouth. 

Im sorry if I gave a lot of extra info, if you are still reading this, thank you! I have yet to come across anyone, in person or online, who shares this odd experience. I miss the absence of thirst, and being able to go outside in the summer without feeling like I just ran a 5k in the middle of the Sahara. 
Any insights would be much appreciated! 


","Hello. Your symptoms could fit a range of conditions. The intense thirst is definitely seen when taking stimulants for ADHD. These ADHD medications can cause you to have a continuous dry mouth (hence the thought to continually consume water). 

Your symptoms, however, with the intense xerostomia, dental caries and abrupt onset after you had already been on the ADHD medications could fit Sjorens Syndrome, an autoimmune disorder. How are your eyes? Do they also get very dry? 

If I had to put my differential diagnosis into a top 3 it would be : 1) Primary polydipsia secondary to ADHD medications 2) Less likely but possible - Sjorens syndrome (any family history of autoimmune disorders?) 3) Less likely - Diabetes (Type 1 would be more likely, and no episodes of DKA by her age would make my suspicion less likely but I would still get a random glucose or A1C).  Good luck. Thanks for sharing your case.","17/F Unquenchable thirst for the past year and a half with no other symptoms whatsoever.

Answer: This patient's symptoms of unquenchable thirst, dry mouth, and dental issues are suggestive of Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the salivary glands, leading to reduced saliva production and dry mouth. However, the lack of other symptoms such as joint pain, skin rashes, or eye problems makes this diagnosis less likely, and further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Your symptoms could fit a range of conditions. The intense thirst is definitely seen when taking stimulants for ADHD. These ADHD medications can cause you to have a continuous dry mouth (hence the thought to continually consume water). Your symptoms, however, with the intense xerostomia, dental caries and abrupt onset after you had already been on the ADHD medications could fit Sjorens Syndrome, an autoimmune disorder. How are your eyes? Do they also get very dry? If I had to put my differential diagnosis into a top 3 it would be : 1) Primary polydipsia secondary to ADHD medications 2) Less likely but possible - Sjorens syndrome (any family history of autoimmune disorders?) 3) Less likely - Diabetes (Type 1 would be more likely, and no episodes of DKA by her age would make my suspicion less likely but I would still get a random glucose or A1C).

17904,Left side of stomach still sore 10 hours after HGH injection,"Age: 18

Duration of Complaint: 10 hours

I bought Human Growth Hormone from an online vendor, mixed it with bacteriostatic water (with 0.9% benzyl alcohol), and proceeded to inject it to the left side of my abdomen 10 hours ago with a 30g needle and a 1ml insulin syringe I bought from a pharmacy. I wiped the area 1 minute prior with an alcohol swab.

I took with my fingers a chunk of fat skin (pinched abdomen fat), held it and tried to inject into it. However, I didn't use enough force when putting the needle in, and the needle ended up going only halfway in before stopping and getting stuck. It just felt like my muscles there are resisting the needle.

 I tried twice more at the same location, and eventually got it all the way in by doing it with a more firm motion. I pushed down the plunger, took out the syringe with the needle attached and threw it away.

Now, 10 hours later, I still feel some slight soreness in the whole left side of my stomach if I bend down or exert it in any way. There's no visible redness or swelling in the area, and the skin color is normal.

It not only hurts now in the area of injection, it's the whole left side. It worsens with exertion of the area, and much less noticeable when sitting down.

Is it possible I damaged a nerve or blood vessel? Is it something I should go to the emergency room urgently?","Why did you do this? 

And we don't know what's going on. You probably either bruised yourself, caused an infection or injected something that really isn't HGH since you can't really trust the internet. If you are worried you should go see a doctor.","Left side of stomach still sore 10 hours after HGH injection

27998,Help Interpreting STD Test Results,"Hi reddit doctors, I will do my best to keep this brief but I am a little freaked out:

I recently went to my doctor and asked for an STD test because I have had a couple partners in the last few months (not normal for me) and I wanted to be cautious. My results came back today and everything seemed straightforward (all clear) until I got to the last result, the HSV-2 test. Here is a picture of what the test says: 

For the life of me I can't tell if the result is saying I have 2.29 H, and therefore I am positive for HSV-2 because 2.29 > .90, or if the 2.29 H is somehow still beneath .90 (since it also says <.90 on the same line). I emailed my physician but they usually take day or two to respond and I am super worried.

Just some other information, I am a 28 year old white male, 5'6"", about 135lbs. I have not had any STD symptoms and always use protection for intercourse. Also I do not take any medication regularly. Any insight would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I cannot understand my HSV-2 test result due to the format and am super worried.","Your HSV2 IgG titer is 2.29, so the test is positive. The <0.90 is the reference value for normal (aka negative).","Help Interpreting STD Test Results

3935,Mole on upper leg,"25, Asian, male, for the last few months I've been having concerns over health problems (largely health anxiety over my digestive system, my life has been hell over the anxiety) But lately I started to take notice again on a particular mole located on the inner side of my leg:



This mole has been there for at least 5-10 years at that size, at least that's when I recall I've had it, and that's a hair follicle there for sure, I was trimming out rogue hair a few days ago. I'm pretty sure that was a spot I trimmed off (not 100% sure though, I used scissors) 

I have a problem with itching and acne down there so I do scratch that place and sometimes mistaken that mole as a pimple, pinching on it since I'm not looking and thought I had my hands on a pimple (bad habit, I know, I'm trying to not do it), so it does feels rough to touch, whether it's because of that hair or because some skin got scratched/pinched off that spot.

I read the ABCDEs of looking at moles by accident (probably shouldn't have clicked on that link) and now I feel kinda paranoid and miserable over this mole since none of my other moles look like this, though none of those have hair growing out of them. Does this warrant an immediate visit to the doctor? 

I'm probably overthinking but...kinda scared, I guess the anxiety two months ago hasn't really left me, I can't shake off the feeling, and this is even worse on Sunday when clinics are all closed.","Asymmetry - It's symmetrical, no worries there.

Border - Your mole seems to be a bit 'deeper', making it hard to see the border. Might be a good idea to have it checked.

Colour - The mole is a bit scabbed over, so I will disregard the scab. The rest of the mole is uniformly coloured. No worries on this point.

Diameter - It seems to be smaller than 0,5 cm, so that's good.

Evolution - It stayed the same for years, so you can be at ease when it comes to this.

Getting it checked out wouldn't be a bad idea. You can have it removed with no problems. If the doctor thinks it is a good idea to send it to a path lab to check it for possible melanoma, he will. In any case, you've done well in checking your moles. The sooner possible melanomas are removed, however small the chance of it actually being a melanoma, the better.","Mole on upper leg

It is almost rare that I get a burning sensation. I've been masturbating for about 5 years but this time I'm very serious on stopping this ugly and pathetic addiction.

I have not had sexual intercourse of any kind. I'm honestly a bit paranoid and I feel like this may lead to something worse (but then again this may be me just scaring myself again).

•I am [33F], 5’6 and 170 pounds. I live in the USA.

•I have a long list of medical issues, including Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, Fibromyalgia, and back/nerve problems. I have three herniated disks in my back, and neuropathy that radiates down my left leg. I am being treated mostly for the IIH, but I do take several prescription medications for pain (no opiates.) I also have ADHD, and am taking adderoll for that.

•I’m from the USA. I grew up on the east coast, but live in Colorado now. 

•I have a lot of medication allergies— including Tramadol (anaphylactic reaction,) Gabapentin (psychological reaction,) and Sulfa drugs. I was also bitten by the Lone Star Tick when I was around 11 years old— which made me allergic to beef and pork. 

•I do not smoke or drink, but I do chew nicorette gum. It helps with the Fibromyalgia. I am not a regular user of marijuana or any other non-prescribed drug, but I have a long list of pharmaceutical meds I am on. If necessary, I’m willing to list my medications. 

•The only new thing I’ve taken this week is ketoconazole— I get a rash on my stomach and back, so every year or so, I do a 7 day treatment before it gets bad again. I’m not sure if it could cause a rash like this. I’ve taken it, off and on, for the last several years, and never had this happen before.

•The rash I’m here about looks absolutely nothing like what I’m used to— I believe the “regular” rash is called roseola (or something like that.) What I usually get is a series of small, oblong red speckles that are a little itchy and turn white when I get a tan. This rash is large, about the size of a quarter or half-dollar— and, as far as I can tell, there’s only the one. 

Oh, and this may be relevant since I’m here about a rash— I use hypoallergenic laundry detergent, body wash, and shampoo. And I haven’t changed or switched any of those recently.

The issue: 

I woke up this morning to a rash. [Here is a photo.]( (Sorry for the poor quality— it was incredibly difficult to get a picture because of where it’s at!) The rash is located on my side, about parallel with my left breast. It’s hot to the touch, and I’ve got dull, throbbing pain that comes in waves. At its worst, the throbbing is rather difficult to ignore. It almost feels like a sunburn; my shirt seems to be irritating it. 

At first, I thought it might be a swollen lymph node (I’m vaccinated, but tested positive for Covid-19 last week, and am quarantining) but it seems too low to be a lymph node. It’s on one of my ribs. My second thought was that it might be a pimple… but no pimple I’ve ever had looks (or feels) like this. 

I know what I’m about to say next is the bane of doctors, but I did some research online— and it looks a little like a bull’s eye rash that’s associated with Lyme Disease.

If this is a Lyme-related rash, it wouldn’t really surprise me. Before my back issues got bad, I spent a lot of time outdoors— I’d go on weeks-long hiking, fishing, and camping trips. My sister was diagnosed with Lyme Disease a few years ago, and we practically lived outside as kids and young adults. 

As far as I know, I’ve never been tested for Lyme.

Is this something I should tell my doctor about at my next appointment? Any help or insight you could give me would be great!

I was induced at 7am that day, the gyno came in 3 different times throughout the day to check on me. The first 2 times she couldn’t find my cervix and said it was pushed so far back, the third time she found it and PULLED IT DOWN. I screamed so loud. It was the worst pain I’ve ever been in in my life. It was worst than contractions, worst than the actual delivery. I get terrible flashbacks of that day and I’m scared to have any more kids because of it. 

I was speaking to an old friend earlier who works in the healthcare field and she told me that the gyno was really wrong for doing that and I should look into my rights.

Is she right? I really don’t know anything when it comes to that and I don’t know if she’s just saying that or if I could actually build a case around that. Just looking for a second opinion I guess. 

(Cross-posted)","So when you phrase it they way you have it doesn't sound appropriate. However, there is a decent chance what happened is you were 1-3 ish centimeters dilated and your gyn was making sure the exam was accurate. I say this because for first time moms, it is not uncommon to have a longer cervix. The outside can be dilated while the inside can be still mostly closed or much narrower.

Sometimes, due to the anatomy, to *really* get an accurate check, we 'drag' down the cervix to get our finger alllll the way in to the tipy top. And by that I mean move your cervix down at most a centimeter. It's not really possible to do much more than that. It is definitely uncomfortable, and we only try to do it when it's super important - such as deciding what to do next during an induction.

If for example someone is 1 cm rather than 3, we will often do different things. So it's important to know. It definitely is uncomfortable though. Cervical exams are just the worst. 

I have always done my best to keep them as brief and gentle as possible, but a variety of factors can make that challenging. 

Good news is that usually for future pregnancies, the cervix tends to be much more open near term, and it would be unlikely you'd need such an aggressive exam or 'pulling' again.","Gynecologists: is it standard procedure to pull down a woman’s cervix during labor?

I'm a 25 year old male who's 100% certain that I have salivary gland C, I got all the symptoms and everything matches up too perfectly, it just can't be a coincidence unfortunately.

Last monday when I was having lunch , I began to feel a swelling under my tongue and noticed that there was a little dot in the middle and that it hurted a lot when I tried to swallow my food. I've also noticed a swelling on my throat, I think that it is where the nodes are located. Looking up the symptoms online, it became clear that this has something to do with my salivary glands.

As of now, the pain and the swelling have been decreasing day by day and I can now eat and chew and drink with no major problem although the bump is still there but I can't shake the feeling that this is something way bigger than just an infection. I went to the ER today but the doctor said she couldn't do anything about it , didn't saw anything worth the fuss and prescribed me an ibuprofen. I got photos of the swelling under the tongue if you need.

I've already booked an appointment for a ENT specialist next week but I'm not sure I can wait that long. This thing feels like a ticking time bomb and I don't want to wait till it's too late. I would really appreciate it if someone could help me, should I be worried , should I go to other ER, should I wait?

Issue-

About 4 months ago I began feeling bladder pressure/ tingling from my belly button to bladder/base of penis, off and on every day after having fairly rough unprotected sex quite often with a girl who claimed to be std free(as was I). I began noticing this when having to urinate more frequently with less volume. I feel spasms in the perineal area that randomly occur. I have also noticed intermittent low-grade fever (98.8-99.4) during daytime hours that come and go, when laying down my temp goes back to normal. This was addressed to my PCP who took urine samples and immediately thought STI, gave me azithromycin for Chlamydia and would let me know if Gonorrhea, Trich, myco/urea, or Syphilis came up. No STI was found and no bacteria was found in my urine. Was given a round of antifungal medicine and as my PCPs last resort was bactrim. It \*seemed\* like the antibiotics helped the symptoms until stopping them. Around this time I did a full panel std test to rule everything out and 3 months later as well. The only thing I can't test for is HPV which I wouldn't think could cause symptoms like this.

I received a referral to a urologist who did an ultrasound and ct scan. Nothing was abnormal in those. I suspected prostatitis, but was told my PSA levels were normal and that the prostate did not appear to be inflamed. If that is ruled out then I am left thinking this is a neurological issue perhaps with my spine sending the wrong signals. A couple of other things to note that occurred around the onset of symptoms: was very dehydrated, went walking through a creek that likely had bad bacteria, went to a chiropractor who did some very violent adjustments(last i went). I know this is alot of information being thrown out there but maybe it is of some use.

My main worry is that I am letting some bacteria or virus run rampant for this long without doing anything. I have tried very hard to be patient- meditating, exercise, eating very healthy, probiotics, but the symptoms persist.

With all this being very expensive, I'm wondering if you have any leads, or know my next step, should it be neurologist, pelvic floor therapist, infectious disease specialist, have a cystoscopy, etc

Thankyou!","The only thing that comes to mind for me is transverse myelitis which is basically inflammation of the spinal cord which can lead to sensory disturbances like tingling, bladder issues, and spasm.

Actually I lied. You should get checked for HIV if you haven’t.  HIV often presents as low grade fever. Also idk if you walked in an area where Lyme disease is a problem, it can be a cause for long term low grade fever. It would otherwise be an atypical presentation of Lyme but is possible.

41824,CT Scan result help understanding,"Fiancee is 24 year old female, non smoker, 5'7"", currently 188 lbs.

Today my fiancee had her CT scan for what is being called at the moment a large abdominal mass. I posted last night in a little more detail but received the CT findings today. I know the primary care physician (family med) thinks it is cancerous or in his words ""likely cancerous"" and he has been extremely helpful and nice during all of this but understandably busy during the covid crisis so it is hard to get timely responses from him.
Anyways, my previous post mentioned they did a transvaginal ultrasound and confirmed a very large (partial solid and partial fluid) mass but couldn't locate the ovaries due to the size of the mass and its location, they sent her for ca125 test and it came back elevated (idk the level, doc only said elevated), and I think the ""findings"" of the scan today are giving us maybe a miniscule amount of good news in the form of I don't think it is spreading to other areas, but would like a medical professionals opinion also. She has an OB appointment Monday but that is a long time to go when we are very worried about her help. Will someone please, in terms someone like me may understand, interpret the results?

FINDINGS
There are no definite abnormalities in visualized lung
bases. There is
22.9 x 20.7x 11.7 cm low-density heart shaped mass in the pelvis extending to the level of the lower edge of the liver.
Pancreas,spleen, liver and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
There is
moderate right and mild left hydronephrosis, likely due to
Compression
of the ureters by this large mass. Few areas of mural
thickening are
seen in the massS.
No definite abnormality is seen in the bladder. Uterus is
flattened
and pushed forward by the mass. Bladder is
decompressed and anterior
to the uterus.
IMPRESSION:
Large low-density mass in the pelvis and abdomen,
concerning for
neoplasm until proven otherwise.","Based on the report there appears to be a very large mass arising from the pelvis (presumably from one of the ovaries) that extends all the way to the level of the liver. The mass appears to be compressing the ureters on both sides causing some degree of urine back-up into the kidneys. Based on the way they describe the other organs the mass does not appear to arise from them (bladder, uterus, etc). The only thing they didn't otherwise mention is the colon, though with a mass this size if it arose from the colon she would likely have GI symptoms you would have described to us.

30 y/o male, 170 lbs, 5’11”


I was in the best shape of my life pre-pandemic. Got the fattest I’ve ever been in my life during the pandemic. Depression factored in, I was turning to sweets and sugar to make me feel better, eating absolute shit, not working out much and without access to a gym I didn’t have the tools that I needed when I did workout to perform at my best. I’m struggling to get back to level I was at before. I’ve lost a lot of the weight I’ve gained so I’ve seen some good progress but I’m still struggling to get where I want to be. I know part of it is inconsistent workouts and my diet. But I know that opiate use affects testosterone and I’m wondering how much of a factor that could be. I’m struggling with opiate use too but even if I stop my illicit opiate use I’ll still be on Suboxone. Can anyone give me an honest answer so I can narrow down on what’s preventing me from getting the results I want? Does opiate use, Suboxone or oxycodone have a noticeable effect on muscle gain in men?","It's not extremely common but I've seen a few cases of actual hypogonadism induced by opioid use. As in opioids actually suppressing the hypothalamus from producing the appropriate signaling hormones and subsequently requiring long term testosterone. That said, I do a lot of addictions medicine, and haven't seen this often. 
Cutting down opioids can only improve your life. You don't need me to tell you how dangerous opioid use - even highly regulated and prescribed - can be. Suboxone is an excellent option in treating opioid use, and the benefits of suboxone is that its dosage is carefully controlled and can be tapered down in a controlled environment. Having a healthcare provider work with you on tapering suboxone (once you've been stable on the therapy of course!) is likely to be much more manageable than just completely stopping the opioid use. I've read some research that suggests that, since suboxone isn't a true opioid (partial agonist), it reduces risks of hypogonadism and testosterone levels tended to be higher in suboxone cohorts instead of other opioids. 

It will also take a long time to build back muscles and endurance. A year+ of sedentary lifestyle with poor nutrition will take time to combat. You're likely starting at a lower baseline than you've been at before. Be patient with yourself and your body. It took a year+ to get here, it'll take at least that to get back.","Does daily opiate use effect your testosterone levels enough to be detrimental to muscle gain?

Location: Summit County, Feet/Ankles


I'm currently working as a chairlift operator at a ski resort. The job requires me to wear insulated/waterproof boots to keep my feet warm. The problem is, I tend to sweat excessively causing my boots and socks to become soaked throughout the work day. After several months of this now, I fear I have developed a case of trench foot (previously thought to be contact dermititis, see link below) 

I have always dried my boots with the liners removed after every shift and I wear Merino Wool socks. However, that is all I have done until now that would have helped prevent my case of trench foot. Just recently, I have begun to change my socks several times throughout the day, be barefooted as much as possible when not at work, and apply powder within my boots before work. I am hopeful that these things will help, but I am not completely confident. Even when changing my socks, they instantly become soaked again upon inserting my feet in my soaked boots. 

I potentially could or could have already caused tissue damage to my foot. Since I have no choice but to work in boots all day, I fear that this may be a huge issue for me if this continues to get worse. 

Should I be looking for a new occupation or is there a decent chance of fighting this? I would hate to be changing my socks and drying my feet many times a day for the rest of the season particularly because my co-workers and supervisors would get upset about how many breaks I'm taking to do so. In kind of in a pickle here, help?

I know this is something people usually do much earlier in their lives, but yesterday i started to explore a bit my own vagina and tried inserting a finger on it.

 Thing is, i don't know if what i felt is normal. As soon a my finger is in i have to bend it around something. There's this somewhat hard, big thing right after the entrance, in the middle of it, on the upper side of the wall. I can pass it by with my finger, and i can feel around it. What could it be? Should i be worried? I thought a vagina was supposed to just be this soft, open canal? 

I don't really have any symptoms, but my menstruation has always been this huge flow on the first and second days, then it pretty much ends - it's irregular, and at least once a month during my period, when my bladder is full, i feel this huge pain after i pee. Not during, after. It starts slow, becomes awful, then goes away as slow as it came in, and doesn't happen again until next month. I've had this for years now. This is honestly all i can think off.

I know i should go to a doctor, i plan to even if i have some anxiety about it, but what should i expect? Should i be worried? My mind kind of already convinced itself that i have cancer. Please help me.

Edit: Grammar, plus another thing i remembered from yesterday: after inserting my finger, i felt this huge urge to pee. I went to pee with a full on bladder 4 times last night after trying this! No blood or anything.","You most likely felt your cervix, which can be in different places, depending on your physical position and at what stage in your cycle you are.

You can help prevent it by peeing more frequently.

My friend is 14, female. She consumed 16 magnesium pills (I looked them up. I think they're laxatives maybe?). She researched and found that you would have to take 5,000 for it to be deadly (for an adult). She has tried to commit suicide many times before and failed.She says her hands are numb, and her stomach hurts. She also got really tired, so she's trying to take a nap right now. I'm on a video call with her watching her fall asleep. Is she going to be ok? If I call someone, it might actually make her worse. She does not want to be sent to a hospital and she doesn't want her parents to know. I don't know what to do. She would definitely try to kill herself if she got in any kind of trouble for this, but at the same time, I just want her to be ok. Should I call the cops? What should I do?  She's home with only her sister, but her sister is asleep and sick.

update: I think she's asleep now. Her full list of symptoms seems to be numb hands, stomach pain, sleepiness, and now lightheadedness.

update - the numbness in my hands have subsided for the most part and is only occasional.  i figured everything is OK since it was actually subsiding.  however, about 3 days ago my toes on my right foot have started to go numb (mostly the big toe really).  it's pretty constant really - unlike my hands which would only go numb if i raised my arms.

long story short - i need to get a physical that i know.  i'm not sure if this is pinched nerves or diabetic neuropathy or something else - but i know i need to get some blood work in order to rule that out.  i won't be able to visit a dr for a few weeks due to my schedule & this doesn't really seem like an emergency.

Location: ear

A little over a year ago my daughter got tubes placed in both ears. 

We had an appointment with a new ENT and an audiologist about ten days ago. We were referred after she failed a hearing screening at her preschool. Her 4th failed test in her left ear in 6 months. We were told her hearing barely passed so she wants to test again more thoroughly in 6 months. She mentioned that her left tube had dislodged and is resting in the ear canal with wax buildup around it. You can see it by just looking in her ear, including the buildup. The last ear infection she had was in the left ear and the doctor said that all of the fluid had collected behind the tube. This was before you could see it by looking in the ear.

I was under the impression that tubes literally fall out of the ear after time. Am I wrong about that? Should I get a second opinion about the tube? I’m thinking the blockage has to be contributing to the failed hearing tests. If it doesn’t fall out will they have to surgically remove it?

Conditions and Medications: eletriptan taken as needed for chronic migraine, Adderall XR daily for ADHD, raynauds in toes dx’d by leg venous ultrasound. Slightly elevated cholesterol and HDL, family history of familial hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Former smoker, quit about 5 years ago. 

So given my size I know it is super common to see a pulse in the stomach. However the area where I feel the pulse, slightly above navel to the left, feels harder than the rest of my abdomen and somewhat tender. It is especially noticeable with a high heart rate when lying down. Sometimes when i push down on it, I get a quick, sharp referred pain to my back under the ribs. Not sure if related but I’ve also noticed recently that the left side of my abdomen feels fuller in general while the right side feels somewhat squishy and “empty.”

I do get anxious about medical things so I find it hard to tell when something is “worth” going to the doctor or not.

These episodes appear to have different triggers: food, menstruation, pain, and stress. I have been seen by Gastroenterologists, Endocrinologists, Neurologists and regular primary care doctors to no avail. Doctors have had many different diagnosis from Diabetes, Gastroparesis, to Abdominal Migraines.

These episodes can last anywhere from 12 hours to four days and are very debilitating as I do not know when they will occur, they are extremely painful, taxing, and my weight has dropped dramatically. When I first started getting these episodes they would not last as long and were less frequent, however, as time has progressed they have gotten increasingly longer, more frequent, and difficult to control.

I have been on an assortment of medications: Sertraline for stress triggers, Reglan and Metoclopramide for Gastroparesis, Topimax and Sumatriptan for migraines, Amitriptyline for mood/stress, and a plethora of different birth controls to prevent menstruation. Ultimately, these medications have had little effect. While having an episode I have tried, Metoclopramide, Sumatriptan injections, oral Zofran/Ondansetron, capsaicin cream, and Benzodiazepines. I am unable to take any oral medication while having an episode as they will ultimately be vomited. The vomiting episodes are very painful and can rarely be treated without a hospital visit and a concoction of intravenous Ativan, Promethazine, and Benadryl. The best solution has been to sleep as long as possible, however, being unable to take oral medication and relax it has been impossible on my own.

During these episodes my blood work is all over the place: glucose in the range of 140-300, elevated Anion Gap, elevated white blood count, elevated Lymphocytes Absolute, elevated Neutrophil percentage, elevated Neutrophils Absolute, elevated Iron Bind Capacity.(TIBC), elevated cholesterol and LDL, and glucose and ketones in urine. My blood work has been the most troubling part to doctors as it is very erratic. While elevated Glucose levels, and Glucose and Ketones in my urine seemed to point to diabetes or pre-diabetes, it has been ruled out through many A1Cs and glucose intolerance tests. My gastric emptying scan was also unclear, the gastric retention of activity at the end of half an hour is 97%, one hr is 96 %, 2 hrs is 73 %, at 3 hrs 23%, at 4 hrs 3%.

28977,Creatinine level decoded?,"Hello everyone, 

My boyfriend recently went to hospital for rhabdomyolysis. He's being treated with an IV and having daily blood tests. 
Our doctor has told us what he creatinine levels were but he's not very good at using layman's terms so I've been googling and trying to understand, but to no avail. 

When my bf was admitted, the doctor said:
 ""Your creatinine levels are over 140,000, we can't tell the exact number because our machine only measures up to 140,000. A normal persons should be at about 200."" 


I want to understand those numbers. I understand creatinine and what it means for the body. What I don't understand is the units of measure being quoted. All I've found so far is creatinine measure in mg/dL could he be saying140000 µg/L, the equivalent of 14.mg/dl? Is that a common way to report the levels ? 
 

I know regardless of the unit of measure my bf's numbers were crazy high  when he was admitted. I just want to know when I can relax a little because the number are approaching ""normal"". That hasn't been defined by the Dr in a way we can understand and I've had no luck translating it to determine what the healthy range would likely be a week after a hard work out.

I don't know if it helps but, he's a 25 year old male, about 200lbs, 6 foot, athletic build, has great cardio and healthy bp & resting hr. 

Thank you in advance!!","Yes, correct! Normal CK levels is up to around 200 U/L and his would have been > 140,000 U/L.

But my doctor didn’t mention this?

I noticed a lot of people don’t get surgery for years and leave this to run its course but the pain is excruciating! I understand if you don’t have healthcare, as I wouldn’t be able to afford care for this otherwise, but are there other reasons as to why people avoid surgery?

Med History: Migraine w/o Aura, Posterior Vitreous Detachment, Posterior Spinal Fusion from Scoliosis (T5-L2), Depression (well-controlled, currently taking Zoloft 50 mg)

Two weeks ago, I experienced what I believe to be my first migraine aura. I've had migraines in the past, but never with aura. With the pandemic ongoing, I spoke with a doctor via teleconference. After describing the aura, he said it seemed to fit the description of something called scintillating scotoma. I have a history of posterior vitreous detachment, but because I experienced positive visual symptoms with a gradual march, he didn't believe it to be a sign of retinal detachment. He also said stroke was unlikely due to my age, not having a history high blood pressure, and lack of other symptoms such as weakness and speech issues. The aura was followed by a headache, but not one I'd describe as a typical painful migraine.

Since that event two weeks ago, I've had a headache nearly every day. The severity waxes and wanes, and the headaches are present at different times of day - sometimes they develop later in the day and sometimes they're present in the morning. I've also been experiencing some feelings of vertigo. I've been working from home due to the pandemic and spending a lot of time on the computer, so I adjusted the color and brightness of my computer display to reduce glare and have been taking screen breaks at regular intervals. I've also been making sure to exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and eat foods rich in vitamins and magnesium. Nothing seems to be helping. 

I'm by no means asking for a diagnosis online, but I would like to know if this sounds like something worth making an appointment to see my doctor in person. With everything going on regarding COVID-19, I'm hesitant to make a doctor's appointment unless it's truly necessary.

5'9"" tall, 185 lbs

BP normal  
NO history of heart disease in the family

Both grand parents died of stroke as the result of Diabetes  
Due to bad lifestyle habits

Both parents are in mid 70s, clean bill of health.

  
So here's my question.

I was stressed yesterday

over worked, plus

had some sugar, salty snacks(I don't usually dabble in things like that) but yesterday I did

A mars bar

Sushi but I dipped the sushi heavy in Soy Sauce with lots of MSG, Salt

Had a coffee

and I was sitting down at my desk and all of a sudden

My heart started to go haywire like erratic, irregular, fast beat and then I got up and went to the bathroom and it was back to normal.

It felt like longer than that but it was probably a 10 secon Afib thing so not bad.

The last time I had such a thing was 1 year ago so they are infrequent

Same thing I noticed last time I had this, I had eatn a greasy burger, with salty fries, coffee and was extremely stressed.

I might have Afib but I think more so I had a heart rhythm irregularity on this occassion due to all of those negative stimulants.

I wasn't experiencing [chest pain]( shortness of breath or even [dizziness](

Any idea what this could have been and if the factors I listed might have caused it? I think I know but just checking to see for reference

Thanks","Sometimes you can have a few ""skipped beats"" in a row (also known as PVCs or PACs) which can feel like a strange, irregular heartbeat. It would be impossible to know if this brief episode was a fib or not without having had you on the monitor. I will say, however, that while a fib can be intermittent or paroxysmal, it generally would last more than 10 seconds if you actually had it. So a brief episode of palpitations is less likely to be a fib. I wouldn't worry about it for now. If you do start noticing more frequent palpitations, the best thing would be to get a heart monitor for a couple of weeks to see if it picks up any a fib. And if you have an episode like this that lasts continuously more than a few minutes, or makes you feel very dizzy like you're about to faint, go to the hospital to see if they can capture what it is.","45M=Anyone experience this?

I seemed to have developed depression around late last year and it got really bad to the point of crying daily which would give me tension headaches. I think what triggered it was struggling to fit in at university, failing at work, and gaining self awareness of how I act. I took birth control pills recently because I thought they would make me feel better. They caused splitting headaches that haven't gone away and impaired my judgement. 

The last pill I took even made me feel frustration and anger which I have never felt before.

I've quit drinking before but nothing like this ever happened to me.  I just did a 5 day hospital alcohol detox.  This was accompanied with a massive gout attack and A-fib.  The usual detox routine, ativan, magnesium, IV fluids, Thiamine plus prednisone for the gout attack and cardizen for the A-fib.

No. They should have put him under anesthesia -- at least conscious sedation.  I don't work with children. But a rule of thumb is that we anesthetize them at least as much as we would an adult, since they're more prone to get freaked out by invasive procedures.

3021,I think my toddler (6Y) lost height..,"  

Is this even possible? My rational mind tells me it isn’t... but...

He is being followed by professionals due to being short (he turned 6 in August and his height is 107cm) since 1 and a half years ago, and due to the fact that he was on the 25-50 percentile and dropped to 3 percentile... When he was 5y, he took x-rays to wrists and his bone age was calculated to 3 and a half years.

He made blood and hormone testes, which came out normal, except for some minor variances which the doctors ruled out as ""normal variances"".

His last appointment was in 22 Set and, in the hospital, they measured him 109,5 cm, which was coincident with the measures we make here at home.

Well... two weeks ago, we measured him here at home and he was about 3 cm below the last mark we had (And it was not an individual mark, there are 5 escalating marks on the wall, and the one for 2 week ago is below the lowest mark from that group of 5 marks...)

I thought it was strange, maybe something I was doing wrong now, so I thought nothing of it and tried again 2 days after, and confirmed that he was 3 cm below... Decided to wait some more, and tried after 2 week (3 days ago), and still... below... 

Decided to measure him in a medical centre and took him there. They measured him 106,9cm...

I try to think they may have been errors in measuring... but... my first measures at home are the same as the one from the hospital... and the second ones, are the same as the medical centre...

I am going to take him to the hospital next week, to confirm the measures (in the last appointment they concluded that the growth was normal and he could stop the appointments), but until then... I am losing my mind with worry....

Dr Google isn't much help...

20892,Omentem Pain Location,"35F, 5’4, 150lbs - endometriosis dx 

Hi,

Quick question, I have surgically diagnosed endometriosis (2 surgeries, post 6 years from the last) and I have been having flares. My GYN told me after my last lap in 2015 that I had adhesions on my omentem but since I was not having pain in that area she did not treat them. 

Dr Notes Post Op: “She had a few adhesions from of the omentum up on the patient's right side. She has no small bowel symptoms or any pain up in that area. This was not treated.”

I’m curious to where I would feel pain if the flares are due to the adhesions that weren’t treated. Would you expect the pain to be typically in the upper right abdomen, close to the gall bladder area if this were the case? 

I booked in with my GYN but she is scheduling out pretty far so I wanted your opinions in case maybe I am having a gall bladder issue (no symptoms other than pain, my appendix has been removed) and if so then I could see a GP for further testing if necessary. I’m pretty sure this is endo related based on my experience but not sure of course.

In summary, could the endo adhesions on my omentem cause pain localized to my upper right abdomen? I know we can have referred pain, etc. but I’m just looking for a general consensus. 

Thank you!","Yes, adhesions in that area could cause pain in that area","Omentem Pain Location

I've had clinical depression with anxiety for 22 years, and had my first admission to psychiatric ward(open) in 2002. I have been prescribed Oxzeapam 25mg for about 14 years, but never abused them, only taken when needed. I have been, since 2002, been prescribed every kind of medication for depression (and also bi-polar, to test effect). I have been through all ""standard ones"" - Effexor, Remeron, Zyprexa, Zoloft, Lithium, Quitapin, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Edronax and possibly a few I don't remember. Mid-2017 is when I started losing all hope and started abusing the benzo(combination of Diazepam and Oxazepam). Some days doeses could be 80mg Diazepam and 50mg Oxazepam, just to give you a indication of size of doses, but there was not a clear pattern in what combination I used them.  

Late 2017 I was again admitted to open psychiatric ward, this time to undergo ECT **for depression**(in bold for relevance to my question below). I did not mention any benzo abuse, just that I had been prescribed them, and that I used them when needed. The had a series of 6 ECT treatments, and they had a short lasting effect, in a good way.

I have been tall for my entire teenage and early adult life, had my growth spurt really early and have been above 6’ since I was 13. Along with that I have experienced moderate to severe back pain. At first I was told it was due to rapid growth, but it has continued well past the point I have stopped growing. I have asked at my last couple check-ups and I have been told that’s pretty much how it goes for taller dudes. I have tried stretching, I’m a pretty active dude and I work out frequently, and 3 days out of the week I’m working in the field which is physically exerting. About three months ago I decided to buy one of those heating pads at Walmart and giving it a shot. Instantly cured. My back has never felt better, I’d say I’m using it way more than I should, probably about two-three hours a day, either on my office chair or around the house when I get home. About two weeks ago I noticed my back getting a bit darker, like it was bruised, and this weekend it looked like an exact match to the Google image results for “Erythema Ab Igne.” I read up about the condition, it’s causes, some studies linking it to an increased risk of some cancers. So I stopped using the heating pad cold turkey. Well we are nearing the end of the week and at this point I’m ready to accept a little skin condition and a slight increased risk of cancer just to have my back feeling normal again. So I’m wondering, is there anything else I should know? Is there a safer way to use this heating pad? From what I can tell some people are more predisposed to this Erythema Ab Igne thing than others, seems like no matter what I use the pad I put myself at further risk. Besides the aesthetic nature of the condition, should I be more worried about it?","All treatments have risks and benefits, and there is also risk in nontreatment.

Any existing relevant medical issues: not really

Current medications: none


I have been tall for my entire teenage and early adult life, had my growth spurt really early and have been above 6’ since I was 13. Along with that I have experienced moderate to severe back pain. At first I was told it was due to rapid growth, but it has continued well past the point I have stopped growing. I have asked at my last couple check-ups and I have been told that’s pretty much how it goes for taller dudes. I have tried stretching, I’m a pretty active dude and I work out frequently, and 3 days out of the week I’m working in the field which is physically exerting. About three months ago I decided to buy one of those heating pads at Walmart and giving it a shot. Instantly cured. My back has never felt better, I’d say I’m using it way more than I should, probably about two-three hours a day, either on my office chair or around the house when I get home. About two weeks ago I noticed my back getting a bit darker, like it was bruised, and this weekend it looked like an exact match to the Google image results for “Erythema Ab Igne.” I read up about the condition, it’s causes, some studies linking it to an increased risk of some cancers. So I stopped using the heating pad cold turkey. Well we are nearing the end of the week and at this point I’m ready to accept a little skin condition and a slight increased risk of cancer just to have my back feeling normal again. So I’m wondering, is there anything else I should know? Is there a safer way to use this heating pad? From what I can tell some people are more predisposed to this Erythema Ab Igne thing than others, seems like no matter what I use the pad I put myself at further risk. Besides the aesthetic nature of the condition, should I be more worried about it?","Answer: You should consider consulting a dermatologist for further evaluation and guidance on managing Erythema Ab Igneum, a condition associated with prolonged heat exposure.

Alright so this started several months ago. Once in a while ( every several weeks ) my heart would beat fast AF and thump suuuper hard and I couldn’t breathe for 3-5 seconds. 


The reason why I say thumps hard is cause it feels like it does and when I touched my chest as it happened once ( don’t do this every time cause my heart beating fast kinda disorients me so I can’t just think “ touch my chest “ as it happens ) it was a noticeable hard thump. 


Since it didn’t happen a lot and lasts so short I was like meh whatever. 



**But now it’s happening almost every day**. It can happen if I’m home chilling playing video games, outside, pretty much anywhere. 





Still lasts about 5 sec, I’ll be doing something and it’ll beat hard and fast AF, and now I automatically gasp for air ( which I never did before ) which is awkward cause I did it in front it family today. While this is happening I think my brains kinda like wtf cause whatever I’m doing before it starts I kinda blank out for a second ( NOT FAINT OR LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS ) 


**i don’t drink coffee**, and yes I exercise ( weightlift ). I started cardio again and yeah got chest pains ( not sharp, like my chest was aching ) but this happened the last time I started doing cardio as well and eventually went away.

23980,Intense Joint Pain with normal labs??? Help.,"I woke up on November 6, 2020 with a dull ache in my lower back. After a week, the dull pain became a sharp pain that travelled down my left buttock and leg. I was unable to lay on my back. I was unable to stand up straight and had to use a cane to support myself. 

On November 17, 2020, I had an appointment with my primary care PA. He ordered an X-ray of my lumbar spine, which showed no abnormalities. I was prescribed Tramadol, Prednisone and Tizanidine. 

In December 2020, I was still experiencing the same pain even with the medication so he ordered an MRI of my lumbar spine, which showed no abnormalities. He prescribed me more of the same medications. 

Within the last week (April 2021), I’ve started to experience pain traveling to different areas of my body. When I wake up my back is stiff and I struggle to walk with pain in my left ankle. Usually, this will subside after taking a shower or within an hour or so of being active. However, my pain returns during the afternoon and in the evenings, I cry because my joints hurt. My wrists, ankles and my back. I have to use a cane to support myself after 5:00 p.m. 

One day, I felt sharp stabbing pains in my wrists, ankles and back while my muscles ached like I had ran a marathon. My PA ordered blood work on Friday.

13153,"Trying to make sense of an autopsy tox report, can anyone help?","Hey everyone. I’m just trying to make sense of my mothers autopsy that I finally received yesterday after weeks of requesting. I knew she died of a heart attack in March, but I also knew that she was addicted to alcohol, benzo medication, and there is the possibility of other addiction as well. Still, I was surprised to find a contributing factor of fentanyl toxicity in her report because I did not know that would be a medication she would use. I’m working on getting her medical records to figure out what medication she was given in the hospital and what she was prescribed with.

Reading into the tox report though, I have some questions that I was hoping someone may be able to answer. She had a heart attack on Tuesday and was in the ICU for two days before she left AMA on Thursday morning. I’m sure she was prescribed medication‘s during that time and as I said, I’m working on getting her medical records. She had high blood pressure so she should’ve been on some kind of blood pressure medication and because of the clots I assume that they would’ve put her on some blood thinner possibly? Not sure how it all works.

Anyway, the only medicines that are showing up on her tax report are not heart related substances. There are several anxiety medications, an antipsychotic which could’ve been prescribed to her for depression, an antihistamine which I know is often prescribed for anxiety, nicotine, caffeine, and then fentanyl. There are no mention of any cardiac medication on this tax screen. I was just wondering if attacks screen only looks for illicit substances? Or could this mean that my mother went home and didn’t take her prescribed medications?

My mom was not a great woman so I’m not looking for somebody to sugarcoat this for me, I’m looking for answers. Basically, I need to know if she died on purpose, and finding out this answer will get me a lot closer to understanding all of this.

I’m happy to provide photos of the actual report if necessary. I think that I read and understood the rules well enough to have done this correctly but if that’s not the case please feel free to let me know if I’ve violated anything.",Tox screens don't look for cardiac medications.,"Trying to make sense of an autopsy tox report, can anyone help?

My lifestyle hasn't changed that much besides cooking all the time at home due to the pandemic and a dose 1000mg per day of metformin.  Should I still be concerned about being pre-diabetic (specifically in regards to the results, not broad lifestyle advice that I'm aware of) or other avenues of testing I should pursue?

I'm really worried. I keep reading about sepsis symptoms, because it also includes low body temp and I'm so scared. Thank you in advance.","It's normal for your axillary temperature to be lower than what we consider a ""normal"" temperature, as it isn't a good measurement. It could also just be that your thermometer isn't very good.

If you had sepsis, you would feel very sick and wouldn't be able to write this right now. Your other symptoms do not seem to be related at all, and I would presume that this is your anxiety rather than any illness that you need to be concerned about.","Low body temperature... need advice

Hello everyone! I'm 18 female, 167cm ( 5'5""), 53 kg (116 lbs) otherwise healthy, struggles with anxiety. My main concern is my body temperature which is quite low. I've had this issue for a week now. My temperature ranged from 35.5C (96F) to 36.1C (97F). I use an electronic thermometer and measure my temperature in my armpit. I feel a bit weak, my feet are sweating and I have no motivation to do anything. What's more, I have troubles with falling asleep at night. I'm not sure if it's directly associated with my condition or it's just my health anxiety keeping me up.

I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis. They may also consider checking for sepsis, but it's less likely given your overall symptoms.

28448,Wondering if I should go get a tetanus booster shot for a minor cut.,"Age: 26 M (185 lbs)

I'm currently building a raised garden bed and I was using an old saw with some rust on it to cut a portion of wood. I had been very cautious about using the saw safely, but I did unfortunately nick myself on the side of my thumb. But not badly. Just a very, very light graze and the scab is maybe a millimetre wide. This was a couple of days ago and I disinfected it with some hydrogen peroxide a few minutes after.

But ever since then i've been paranoid about tetanus. I did rest the saw on its side in some dry soil prior to sawing and I understand via research that's where the tetanus bacteria lies. So even though my cut is very very small and didn't cut deep at all in my skin, I am wondering if I should go get a tetanus booster shot.

I don't know my vaccination history. I do know I for sure had the tetanus shot as a kid along with all other routine vaccinations... But i'm not sure if i've had a booster shot again since.

Age: 26 M (185 lbs)

I'm currently building a raised garden bed and I was using an old saw with some rust on it to cut a portion of wood. I had been very cautious about using the saw safely, but I did unfortunately nick myself on the side of my thumb. But not badly. Just a very, very light graze and the scab is maybe a millimetre wide. This was a couple of days ago and I disinfected it with some hydrogen peroxide a few minutes after.

But ever since then i've been paranoid about tetanus. I did rest the saw on its side in some dry soil prior to sawing and I understand via research that's where the tetanus bacteria lies. So even though my cut is very very small and didn't cut deep at all in my skin, I am wondering if I should go get a tetanus booster shot.

I don't know my vaccination history. I do know I for sure had the tetanus shot as a kid along with all other routine vaccinations... But i'm not sure if i've had a booster shot again since.

I need help from someone. I've had TMJ for almost 10 years, and it's not getting better. My main issues are:

- very loud tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
- severe migraines
- spine/neck issues, causing a plethora of alignment issues, causing even walking to feel different
- vertigo
- loud cracks/pops, about 50 times a day

The things that I tried are:

- braces (currently on my SECOND treatment of them)
- physical therapy
- deep tissue massage
- upper cervical care (almost completely absolves my spine alignment issues, but comes back after about a week)
- orthotic devices: I've had 3 in total
- Arthroscopy TMJ surgery: this was my most major treatment done. I was promised the world in terms of having everything fixed. it did NOTHING.

I'm at my wits end. every little thing is irritable. I lose my crap when someone asks me how my day is, or what I want to eat. I can't eat ANYTHING anymore, not even soft foods. Bananas will still make my jaw stiff and head ache and cause vertigo. On top of that I am unable to chew anything without really bad migraines and jaw stiffness the next day, so I don't even enjoy eating anymore, only do it because I NEED to.

I can't sleep anymore. I think the last time I had a true, real deep sleep, was back in 2012. That's when I thought my tinnitus was ""bad"". now it's almost 5x as loud. I can't focus my attention on anything; I literally wake up out of bed thinking of pain and discomfort, and then go to sleep thinking of the same thing.

I'm in therapy for anxiety. I used to take anti-depressants because I couldn't sleep due to how loud my tinnitus was. I literally don't know what to do anymore. I do have suicidal thoughts, but haven't acted upon them. It's tiring trying to do your best to find a miracle doctor, and being promised the world, only the have them not care as much anymore as soon the as money hits their bank accounts. I know that sounds rude, but thats just how I feel sometimes, because I explain all my issues and they sound very caring and empathetic, but the next time I come to my appt. they seem to forget everything that I told them.

I will list some resources that shed light on my problems. My TMJ goes deeper than just being fitted with an ""orthotic appliance"". I've had 3 of them before, and while they helped, they never really cured anything. Braces seems to make my TMJ worse. 

I'm losing patience, sleep, focus, and attention. I'm starting to get talks about my performance slipping at work, when I used to be a star performer. I don't know what to do anymore. While I was able to pay for services in the past, due to the pandemic and economic downturn, I'm suddenly unable to pay for services as easily anymore.

People freak out when I show them my jaw pops. It's become so normalized for me that I forget that it isn't. it is LOUD and obnoxious. I have to do it after I eat because that's how I find the little bit of relief from the tension and strain on my jaw. 

There are 2mm of space between my posterior teeth on both sides. I think it got that big because of my first treatment of braces. currently my TMJ specialist is working on trying to restore that space in between. But I personally feel like it is deeper than that. in 2008, I had an erupted wisdom tooth that came impacted sideways. I believe it pushed my teeth towards the front. The other 3 wisdom teeth came out but more straighter, but I remember having facial pains when they were starting to erupt. During this time, I already had tinnitus, but nothing other than that in regards to TMJ symptoms. It wasn't until 2011 when I started to have jaw clicks and eventualy bodily pains and shoulder/neck pains.

Does my teeth need to be pulled ""back"" into it's original position before the wisdom teeth came out? My current TMJ specialist who I just started visiting doesn't think it has any impact on my TMJ, and thinks its just the open space between my teeth. 

I'm going crazy with pain. I let it go this long become it's so slow settling and I get used to it, but recently I started smoking weed to cope with the pain and anxiety, and while I'm intoxicated, I have a true moment of clarity where I feel ALL of the pain at once, and I myself am just shocked at how much I have to endure to live like this.

Please help... I don't know what to do. 

Thanks","I’m a dentist and I would advise going to a dental school (or some sort of facility with dental research, but generally dental schools are your best bet) and seeing an orofacial pain/TMD specialist. TMD stands for temporomandibular disorder, the term for TMJ disorders. There are not that many out there, and it is not a recognized dental specialty, but I know of one at a dental school where the dentist solely focuses on people with horrible pain related to the TMJ and face and works with a physical therapist to help alleviate the issues. The one I’m familiar with prescribes a lot of muscle relaxants and uses massage and home therapy. 

I don’t think TMD can always be treated by orthotic devices or braces, either. It depends on the case, but I would be worried about there being any actual degradation within the TMJs on either side. I assume you’ve had some sort of panoramic radiograph or even hopefully a cone beam CT scan to monitor your joints!

The popping in the TMJ is not always an issue in and of itself, but it has to do with the joint’s rotation and glide motion having some interference to get back to the resting position.

The way that I learned it, the spaces you have between your top and bottom teeth really COULD be a sign that there is degradation of your joint. If you think about it, if the hinge that connects your maxilla (top) and mandible changes, then your teeth are unable to come together the same way. Based on your symptoms, it sounds like the joint problem is causing the tooth problem, and moving the teeth around (braces) is not going to address the fact that the joint is breaking down. It is more likely that than the braces causing the posterior space, but I could be wrong. It sounds like a lot of different treatments have been attempted so far. 

I really hope you’re able to find an orofacial pain/TMD specialist!!! I think you really need someone who is familiar with joint degradation to help you out more fully, and this is a case that I personally as a general dentist would not be able to treat alone.

Edit: Also, going to a sleep specialist and having a sleep study done is not a bad idea either! Sleep apnea could definitely be contributing to the migraines and irritability, but I am very suspicious of actual TMJ degradation based on the inability to eat and just the amount of pain you’re experiencing.","30M - Severe health issues due to TMJ.

It's tiring trying to do your best to find a miracle doctor, and being promised the world, only the have them not care as much anymore as soon the as money hits their bank accounts. I know that sounds rude, but thats just how I feel sometimes, because I explain all my issues and they sound very caring and empathetic, but the next time I come to my appt. they seem to forget everything that I told them.

I will list some resources that shed light on my problems. My TMJ goes deeper than just being fitted with an ""orthotic appliance"". I've had 3 of them before, and while they helped, they never really cured anything. Braces seems to make my TMJ worse. 

I'm losing patience, sleep, focus, and attention. I'm starting to get talks about my performance slipping at work, when I used to be a star performer. I don't know what to do anymore. While I was able to pay for services in the past, due to the pandemic and economic downturn, I'm suddenly unable to pay for services as easily anymore.

People freak out when I show them my jaw pops. It's become so normalized for me that I forget that it isn't. it is LOUD and obnoxious. I have to do it after I eat because that's how I find the little bit of relief from the tension and strain on my jaw. 

There are 2mm of space between my posterior teeth on both sides. I think it got that big because of my first treatment of braces. currently my TMJ specialist is working on trying to restore that space in between. But I personally feel like it is deeper than that. in 2008, I had an erupted wisdom tooth that came impacted sideways. I believe it pushed my teeth towards the front. The other 3 wisdom teeth came out but more straighter, but I remember having facial pains when they were starting to erupt. During this time, I already had tinnitus, but nothing other than that in regards to TMJ symptoms. It wasn't until 2011 when I started to have jaw clicks and eventualy bodily pains and shoulder/neck pains.

Does my teeth need to be pulled ""back"" into it's original position before the wisdom teeth came out? My current TMJ specialist who I just started visiting doesn't think it has any impact on my TMJ, and thinks its just the open space between my teeth. 

I'm going crazy with pain. I let it go this long become it's so slow settling and I get used to it, but recently I started smoking weed to cope with the pain and anxiety, and while I'm intoxicated, I have a true moment of clarity where I feel ALL of the pain at once, and I myself am just shocked at how much I have to endure to live like this.

Please help... I don't know what to do.

I'm so sorry for the lengthy note. I'm just so",,"I’m a dentist and I would advise going to a dental school (or some sort of facility with dental research, but generally dental schools are your best bet) and seeing an orofacial pain/TMD specialist. TMD stands for temporomandibular disorder, the term for TMJ disorders. There are not that many out there, and it is not a recognized dental specialty, but I know of one at a dental school where the dentist solely focuses on people with horrible pain related to the TMJ and face and works with a physical therapist to help alleviate the issues. The one I’m familiar with prescribes a lot of muscle relaxants and uses massage and home therapy. I don’t think TMD can always be treated by orthotic devices or braces, either. It depends on the case, but I would be worried about there being any actual degradation within the TMJs on either side. I assume you’ve had some sort of panoramic radiograph or even hopefully a cone beam CT scan to monitor your joints! The popping in the TMJ is not always an issue in and of itself, but it has to do with the joint’s rotation and glide motion having some interference to get back to the resting position. The way that I learned it, the spaces you have between your top and bottom teeth really COULD be a sign that there is degradation of your joint. If you think about it, if the hinge that connects your maxilla (top) and mandible changes, then your teeth are unable to come together the same way. Based on your symptoms, it sounds like the joint problem is causing the tooth problem, and moving the teeth around (braces) is not going to address the fact that the joint is breaking down. It is more likely that than the braces causing the posterior space, but I could be wrong. It sounds like a lot of different treatments have been attempted so far. I really hope you’re able to find an orofacial pain/TMD specialist!!! I think you really need someone who is familiar with joint degradation to help you out more fully, and this is a case that I personally as a general dentist would not be able to treat alone. Edit: Also, going to a sleep specialist and having a sleep study done is not a bad idea either! Sleep apnea could definitely be contributing to the migraines and irritability, but I am very suspicious of actual TMJ degradation based on the inability to eat and just the amount of pain you’re experiencing.","I'm not sure if I should trust him.

8596,[49M] Dad had a mild stroke,"Dad (49M)/80kg/6’ tall

TL;DR Dad had a mild stroke and doctors said he will permanently have bad temperament and lots of hallucinations. 

For some background, my dad has always had hypertension but he lives a very healthy lifestyle. He’s very active, loves doing outdoor activities, a pescetarian, gets regular checkups and is good at taking his maintenance meds (Norvasc/Amlodipine)

Three days ago, he suddenly felt the left side of his face and body go numb and he couldn’t walk and had to be carried by my brothers to the car. My step mum immediately rushed him to the hospital and he was admitted to the ICU. We were informed it was a mild stroke. His sugar spiked up, his potassium is low and they had a hard time getting down his BP. His CT scans also showed a blood clot in the brain as a result of the stroke.  

He was transferred to a private room today because his vital signs were finally stable. He could lift his leg, talk properly but the left side of his face drooped and he said the part from the left shoulder to the hand felt numb. We were allowed to visit him today and he looked well and was happy to see us.

About two hours later, our mum called us to ask one of my brothers to come because my dad was uncontrollably flying into a rage , mumbling things and doing all sorts of crazy like trying to take off his IV and stripping his hospital gown. They had to sedate him. 

The doctor said he was hallucinating and we thought it was because of one of his meds which is Tramadol, known to cause hallucinations. Unfortunately, the blood clot is causing him to feel all sorts of things. He further said that this is a permanent side effect of the stroke and that we should prepare ourselves emotionally to be able to deal with it. I’m very worried as I’m not used to seeing my dad like this. 

Also, rehab is currently not available due to covid so we have to do his exercises at home.

Is this really a permanent thing? What can we expect after he’s discharged from the hospital? I’m also worried about our step mum who has had to deal with this herself and will be dealing with it further along once we all go back to school.","Stroke recovery is a long, slow, and drawn out process. I can’t speak for the other doctor but I would hesitate to call any abnormal psychiatric or cognitive symptoms as permanent or irreversible this early in any patient such as your father. You should anticipate his improvement occurring over the next 3-6 months, which will be optimized if he works hard in therapy and has good support. Sounds like tramadol does not work well for him and should be avoided. Many experience fluctuations in their mental status newly post-stroke and often these can be managed with verbal support/redirection (remind him where/when it is, soothe him when he upsets, etc) and ensuring he sleeps at night and is awake during the day to do therapy. Sometimes mild antipsychotics or other medications may be utilized in the short term if unmanageable otherwise. 

I wish the best of luck to your father and your whole family in the coming months. Keep reminding him (and yourself/your family) that his recovery will be quite slow, so don’t get discouraged and just keep working!","[49M] Dad had a mild stroke

41404,Heart problem signs in young male but nothing showing up on results?,"Hello Askdocs, at this point I think I'm going a bit crazy as my doctor says I'm fine and yet I continue to exhibit symptoms of some kind of heart issue. I never had a problem with anxiety or stress either before you come to that conclusion. Also I'm a 21 year old male with no previous health issue nor does my family have any heart problem. I am not overweight and I eat pretty healthy though I don't exercise as often as I would like.

It started about 2 weeks ago when I woke up in the middle of the night with a stabbing pain in my chest that went away after 2-3 minutes and I quickly fell asleep as I was so tired. I didn't think much on it but ever since that night I had trouble with chest pain that seemed to revolve around my left breast, it wouldn't be crushing or heavy like a heart attack, more like a  strong discomfort that would linger for a while. A couple times it didn't go away for a few minutes and I felt dizzy, suddenly my heart started beating extremely fast and I would think ""Yea I'm about to go into cardiac arrest"" until it went away. For some reason my heartrate has started going up in random moments, usually when I try to go to sleep ever since these episodes that I suspected arrhythmia.

After I got dizzy I went to the ER and they gave me an ECG and bloodtest but it came out all normal so they ruled out heart attack and sent me on my way. After a couple days, I got pretty bad trying to sleep again as everytime I would nearly fall asleep my heart would kind of -jolt- me awake as if an electric current went through me, then my heartrate would go up really fast. I would look online for my symptoms and it would say that I either have some sort of electrical heart issue, a blockage in my artery or anxiety/stress problems. I have never had anxiety problems and right now I'm just trying to enjoy my vacation and there really is nothing in my mind to bother me.

About a week in, my arms especially my left started to have discomfort and shooting pains every now and then, sometimes my fingertips would tingle. This especially freaked me out so I booked a cardiologist appointment. I explained my symptoms and the night jolting/heart rate problems and he looked at my heart with an ultrasound and sent me to get an ecg and a treadmill test ecg. He looked over the results and told me I was fine and should maybe just exercise more. I got home and the symptoms continued so I researched that some heart conditions or rhythm problems could maybe not show up on an ecg which didn't help.

Yesterday I couldn't sleep until 6 am, I got woken up about 15 times with the ""Jolting Heart"" affect and my heartrate went up about 5-6 times to rates so fast that I could hear it through my skin. I'm trying to be strong willed about this Reddit and not let some heart shit scare t a 21 year old healthy man, but it's freaking me out. Any help to shed some light would be appreciated.","The many tests you've received just about 100% rule out a cardiac problem. Unless you do cocaine or some other illicit drugs periodically, then you're certainly fine from a heart standpoint. That said, the thing about anxiety is that it doesn't need a cause, it's the body's inappropriate anxious response to things that shouldn't normally make you anxious (like falling asleep). This is almost picture-perfect anxiety. You should go to your primary care physician to discuss that possibility.","Heart problem signs in young male but nothing showing up on results?

It started about 2 weeks ago when I woke up in the middle of the night with a stabbing pain in my chest that went away after 2-3 minutes and I quickly fell asleep as I was so tired. I didn't think much on it but ever since that night I had trouble with chest pain that seemed to revolve around my left breast, it wouldn't be crushing or heavy like a heart attack, more like a  strong discomfort that would linger for a while. A couple times it didn't go away for a few minutes and I felt dizzy, suddenly my heart started beating extremely fast and I would think ""Yea I'm about to go into cardiac arrest"" until it went away. For some reason my heartrate has started going up in random moments, usually when I try to go to sleep ever since these episodes that I suspected arrhythmia.

After I got dizzy I went to the ER and they gave me an ECG and bloodtest but it came out all normal so they ruled out heart attack and sent me on my way. After a couple days, I got pretty bad trying to sleep again as everytime I would nearly fall asleep my heart would kind of -jolt- me awake as if an electric current went through me, then my heartrate would go up really fast. I would look online for my symptoms and it would say that I either have some sort of electrical heart issue, a blockage in my artery or anxiety/stress problems. I have never had anxiety problems and right now I'm just trying to enjoy my vacation and there really is nothing in my mind to bother me.

About a week in, my arms especially my left started to have discomfort and shooting pains every now and then, sometimes my fingertips would tingle. This especially freaked me out so I booked a cardiologist appointment. I explained my symptoms and the night jolting/heart rate problems and he looked at my heart with an ultrasound and sent me to get an ecg and a treadmill test ecg. He looked over the results and told me I was fine and should maybe just exercise more. I got home and the symptoms continued so I researched that some heart conditions or rhythm problems could maybe not show up on an ecg which didn't help.

Yesterday I couldn't sleep until 6 am, I got woken up about 15 times with the ""Jolting Heart"" affect and my heartrate went up about 5-6 times to rates so fast that I could hear it through my skin. I'm trying to be strong willed about this Reddit and not let some heart shit scare t a 21 year old healthy man, but it's freaking me out. Any help to shed some light would be appreciated.","Answer: It's possible that you may have a condition known as Brugada syndrome or Long QT syndrome, which can cause abnormal heart rhythms and chest pain, but may not show up on a standard ECG.

As the topic implies, I haven’t had a normal bowel movement in a couple of weeks, and I’m hoping to get some guidance on what it might be. 

I am a 46M, 220lbs, 5’9”, Caucasian and a couple of weeks ago I noticed that my bowel movements had changed from a standard movement to one that has started to cause concern.  When I try to have a bowel movement now it is because I feel bloated and when I sit on the toilet it’s basically a lot of wet gas and that is about it. When I do actually have a bowel movement where I am able to excrete actual stool, it’s usually just small to medium size clumps/nuggets and not a solid piece of stool.  Also, sometimes when I pass stool there will be blood accompanied with it which has concerned me the most.  It doesn’t happen all the time, but it does.  When I’m done, or feel that I’m done with my movement and clean up and leave the bathroom I’ll feel bloated again like 30-45min later.  

I looked up my symptoms on WebMD and of course it says I have Colon Cancer, which is alarming to say the least. I have an appointment with my gastro doctor for Thursday this week and I’m sure he’s going to schedule me for a colonoscopy, but was hoping to get some sort of response from a physician who might know if this could be something other than colon cancer, as no one in my family has a history of this disease.  

Thank you!!","The blood in stool could have multiple reasons like a trauma on your anus or a hemorrhoid, but it could also be polyps or something malignant. Hard to rule anything out. So it's good you're seeing a gastroenterologist.

The bloating could be due to some food intolerance or even an acute gastroenteritis.

Again, I'd suggest seeing the gastro and getting the colonoscopy. But usually an acute onset issue like this is more likely to be benign than malignant. You'll know more next week. Until then try some bland diet with potatoes-rice and replenish your electrolytes and water a bit (broth, tea, water...)","46M - Haven’t had a normal bowel movement in a couple of weeks.

Should I still keep doing the exercises more, and if there's no significant improvement, what should I do? And I'm frustrated because I have good range of motion but I still have pain.I'm still young, 19 years and I want to feel the way I do. I feel like I have no control of my life whatsoever.

1.) Impotence or erectile dysfunction does not happen in all patients who take finasteride. According to clinical trials, the majority of men did not experience ED. It is a possible side-effect, but it might not even happen—so no need to worry.

2.) If you begin to experience these unintended side effects, you can speak with your doctor and discontinue finasteride. The side effects will go away. Problem solved!

Finasteride is prescribed to treat BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and male baldness. I assume that you are taking it for your hair, correct? Please correct me if I am wrong.

If you are beginning finasteride to treat male pattern baldness, patients are typically prescribed 1mg once daily. This is a lower dose compared to the dosage prescribed for BPH. Again, correct me if I am wrong, but if you are prescribed 1 mg tablets for hair loss, the chances of side effects decrease with lower doses.

If you experience ED, you can talk to your doctor and seek alternative treatment, so there is no need to think about it!","How do I avoid the nocebo effect?

Now, I know that they are possibly either a pimple or an ingrown hair (at least they’re the most likely.) The smaller of the two I’ve had for about 6 months and the slightly larger one I have had for about one month. I’m not sure when the first appeared, but I know the second one showed up after I shaved down there.

The only thing I find weird is that they won’t go away and they don’t look like ingrown hairs or pimples (maybe they will to someone else, but not me.) They’re normally flesh colored until I try and pop them. 

I’ve tried warm compress, popping them, acne solutions, and even putting alcohol on them with a q-tip. They’ve both sort of popped before? Like clear liquid came out and some blood.

30661,I still can't see after getting an eye exam and new lenses,"Edit: I don't wear contacts at all. I just had them to try them out and in the end contacts are just a lot more trouble than they're worth to me. The boxes were just a reference for my old script.


25F caucasian; Pennsylvania U.S.A.; 5'5""; 180lbs and still slowly losing more; no alcohol/smoking/drugs; Mostly normal health (IBS, PACs, and mental health)- no eye history for myself except I've had glasses since I was 9 (2003/2004 school year, not sure if I constantly worse glasses then, but I know I ALWAYS had to wear them since at least 12 y/o which was 2006); 30mg Vyvanse since May 2019 and 100mg Zoloft since July 2019; I believe blood relatives on my moms side had cataract surgery and some other kind of eye surgery too (uncle and pap); I don't have my current script but have sample contacts still from the end of 2016 which is this pic. Left eye is the left side, and right eye is the right side.  Vision is definitely worse now though. L is probably 2.25 and R 3.0? No idea. That's a guess. I did make a post for this in r/optometry too so I can hopefully get some kind of answer from someone.


So to explain the title a bit more, literally every time I go for my eye exam, I tell the doctor that things are still fuzzy, but I can still make out what I have to read almost all the time and that I squint still to make it more clear (I don't want to say I can't read it but I say that I can take a guess that the circle looks full so it's an O instead of a C. Should I say that I can't read it then?). I go to Visionworks so I have NEVER seen the same doctor more than once. You would think that due to this, at least one of them would take my concern into consideration and spend a little extra time addressing this issue with me- be it explaining why that is or seeing if the new script can be adjusted more or not. But it's a chain company so they're really only concerned with making money. I understand that here on the internet all you guys can do is give suggestions/explanations for what you do and can't give a good answer as I'm not your patient and you haven't given me an exam.


I can't read road signs at night because everything is really fuzzy, but because I know the area, I know what the signs are, or based off the shape/color I can make a really good guess on what it is. It isn't until I'm right next to the sign I can see it, and at night it's still slightly fuzzy. Knowing where the lanes are really sucks too as where I live, they don't have enough reflectors on the lines in the road and the paint is so faded/old it doesn't illuminate in your headlights anymore (in my opinion). Not to mention all the vehicles with LED lights just blind you and the buttholes that drive with their brights on too don't help being able to see. I avoid driving at night as much as I can unless it's when there is just about no one else on the road. During the day I still can't clearly read large signs but I can read them better than I can at night. That makes me think that the reflections and lights that make all the different signs visible cause me to not be able to read the signs clearly, but I can see them better in natural light.


My big issue though is right now. I thought with my insurance I was able to get an exam and glasses every 6 months. Not an exam every 6 and glasses ever 12. So I go get an exam at the start of September I think (August or September) because my current script from Dec 2018 is not good for me anymore and I thought I could get new lenses at that time. I again explain to this doc I've never had before that I everything is really fuzzy and I can't read any signs without squinting and I obviously can't go like that all the time as I have glasses to fix this issue. I'm an EMT and am working on getting back in with a service so I need to have the best vision I can have- especially if I'm going to be driving and my partner is caring for the patient in the back and I work the second shift or especially if I'm working the 3rd/overnight shift. Go figure, doc said my script only changed a tiny bit. How can such a tiny change cause me to not be able to see clearly at all?? When I was voicing my concerns the doc didn't really seem to care and wanted to get me out the door when I was asking questions.


The last time I had the dilation drops will be 3 years ago this year and last year the tech/doc said that since I had it done recently I didn't *have* to get it done again (I have to pay out of pocket for it so I just go for exam and frames as I'm broke and work doesn't pay enough). And when I had the drops, people complain that things are blurry and a lot brighter, but, I literally notice no difference as everything is still blurry even without the dilation drops. And the brightness, I can't explain that. So all those extra tests that I paid for once before too, they said everything was normal and healthy. I just know you should get the dilation drops every so often as that's the most important of the 3 extra tests they ask if you want to add on.


Is there something that can be done to fix this issue for me? Should I phone around to different offices to see if they will address my concerns and set more time aside for me instead of rushing me out? Is this just how it's supposed to be and my thoughts of crisp/clear vision actually isn't a thing? (Like, when you take a pic on your phone with a good camera and it is nice and clear and crisp is what I mean. Maybe not as crisp as the picture as I understand that's technology, but I hope what I'm saying is being explained well). Do I potentially have something else wrong with my vision that previous docs just haven't cared to address when I tell them my issues/concerns?

No existing physical medical problems 
Some anxiety 

3 days postpartum with my first child, I ended up in the ER for chest pain. They weren’t sure what it was, so they recommended a chest CT scan to r/o blood clots, but the first chest CT scan failed to show the smaller vessels in the outer periphery of my lungs. It was recommended to do a second chest CT scan, which also failed to show the periphery. I ended up being sent home, and being healthy.

My question is: is having 2 CT scans in one day too much radiation? Does it increase my chances of cancer being that it was a chest CT and vital organs that are constantly making new cells? Should I avoid CT and X-ray for a certain amount of time? I think the 2 CT scans equates to like 7 years of background radiation exposure. 

I try to not get anxious about it, but I think having a new baby that I want to be around for an extremely long time contributes to my anxiousness.

On the 22nd I took her to the ER when she was experiencing fatigue, weakness (needed to be assisted to walk), coughing, nausea and severe diarrhea).  They gave her the test but told her that it would take 3-5 days for the results.  Even though they found fluid in her lungs, they told her (I couldn’t be in the building with her) that it wasn’t enough to warrant her to be admitted.

We went back the next day because after I helped her to the bathroom, after about a minute of sitting, her eyes went wide open and she started leaning to one side.  I was barely able to grab her before she hit the tub.  After about a minute, she was able to talk again, and remembered nothing.  I noticed her face after she recovered was white with a slight greenish tint.

After that visit, on top of being told that the fluid in her lungs were a little worse with fluid, she was told that unless she can’t walk without assistance, showed signs of a heart attack, or stroke, or lost consciousness for more than 2 minutes, she was not considered an emergency.

Now she has two new symptoms within 48 hours that has me very concerned.  Not only does she still have the above symptoms (including feeling faint every time she uses the bathroom, though she did not pass out), but she has confusion (at times she talks, then in mid sentence stops, then states that she forgot what she was saying, or she just says something random that doesn’t make sense, then forgets what she was saying.  This happens mostly at night).  The other is loss of appetite.  She has not eaten in 48 hours, only water.

We called the hospital today (27th) because we heard nothing from the results.  The ER said that the office that had the test was closed and to try again tomorrow.

I want to take her to the hospital again, but she doesn’t want to go she said that would be a waste of money.  Even after insurance it’s around $500/visit, from past visits to this hospital.

28097,Levodopa and SSRIs,"Age: 32
Gender: FtM
Location: USA
Duration of complaint: 27 years/10 years
Health Issues: primary dystonia, CRPS/neuropathy, chronic migraines, IBS, Chiari malformation, Raynaud's syndrome, undiagnosed blood pressure issue (seeing cardio in January), PTSD, complicated grief, vitamin D deficiency 
Rx: hyosciamine, gabapentin, sinemet, Zoloft, vitamin D, testosterone 

So I apologize if this isn't appropriate to this forum but it seems the best suited on Reddit. This is a question about being medically complicated. 

I have dopa responsive generalized childhood onset dystonia. I am also negative for any of the known DYT genes. I take levodopa-carbidopa extended release three times a day to manage it.  

I am also on a low dose (75 mg) daily for the complicated grief. My psychiatrist doesn't want to go any higher because he is worried about it complicating my levodopa/dystonia situation. 

I know DRD is a rare disease and Parkinson's, while closely related, isn't a perfect mirror by any stretch of the imagination. 

Do we know if going higher on my Zoloft would cause problems? I know I am wary of playing too much with two neurochemicals at the same time but right now my grief is peaking to the point that my grief therapist suggested pushing myself to a break down (safely at home with friends). I would like a buffer from my pain and honestly don't feel like Zoloft is doing anything. 

Alternatively, if SSRIs are dangerous for levodopa patients, are there better medications for us?","I know nothing about DYT, so everything I say is based on Parkinson's, which as you say is not the same.

In Parkinson's, there is concern that SSRIs can worsen motor symptom, but in all studies I've seen they've either been neutral or had improvement in motor symptoms. SSRIs are also routinely combined with carbidopa-levodopa, so I'm not sure what the worry is. Carbidopa-levodopa is sometimes combined with selegiline, which can be dangerous with SSRIs.

On top of that, there's also limited evidence that SSRIs help with complicated grief. But there is some, so if you're going to try Zoloft you might as well try a full dose.","Levodopa and SSRIs

4246,My eyes hurt after doing my makeup.,"Hey there ! 19 y/o Hispanic female here. I’m 4’11 and weight around 95 pounds. Location is my eyes! Haha . This has been happening possibly a few times in the past but has been getting worse in the past month, almost to where i won’t want to do anything for the rest of the day. A bit of information that could help with this is that I do wear glasses. I know my prescription is very strong I have very bad eyesight I can’t see anything without them and need to see things up close when i don’t have them on. As for medications I am taking birth control pills daily, no recreational drugs, and I do not smoke. 

Every time I do my makeup I’ll end up feeling very tired in the eyes and it’ll bother me for the rest of my day. I’ll even want to fall asleep to “rest” my eyes. I don’t know how long it’s been like this but I feel as if it’s been getting worse. I do recall feeling this way before but just recently (for the past month or two) it’s been EVERY time I do my makeup. And because of this I’ve tried minimizing the days I do so. 

As for reasons why this could be I thought it was the light I used, an LED lamp from Walmart. I would have it directly in my face to see what I’m doing. I’ve stopped doing so because I thought it was that. It didn’t change anything. My other guess what that my eyes might just dry out from having them open ? But I’m not too sure about that. I’ve tried doing anything to change it but the only thing that doesn’t make my eyes feel tired or strained is to just not do my makeup! 

Again what happens is my eyes feel tired, almost like they “burn” and I want to sleep to help it feel better. When this happens I am very sensitive to lights and the outside sunlight. 

Please help ! I want to be able to enjoy what I love without it affecting my day, and even mood now. I am planning on going to an eye doctor as well to get a checkup and to possibly get new glasses as to maybe it’s my eyesight getting worse !

I hope the information was enough but if there’s anymore information needed I will gladly do so. ","How old is the makeup you are using? When is the last time you cleaned your brushes?

I have a medical history with epilepsy as an infant until age 14; my seizures were just staring spells, with more severe seizures as an infant. My question is in regard to something from when I was 11. I was fairly tall and skinny for my age, but I want to clarify that I've never had any other medical issues, and I'm pretty healthy.

So when I turned 11 I had to get a biopsy after a routine MRI showed that there was a walnut-sized lump in my brain, around the top-right side. I was pretty young at the time, so I didn't understand what a tumor meant, much less how serious the situation was, so I only recall what my mom explained to me. Anyways, the results came in, and according to them, they had no clue what the lump was; according to my mom, they described it as a ""ball of mass"".  They observed me for some time to make sure I didn't have any seizures after, and eventually my seizures were less and less until I no longer needed check-ups.

My question is, does anyone have any theories as to what this mass is?? It never got removed, so it's still there, and I never had any other severe seizures or anything like that, but I'm so curious to have some sort of answer. Mainly I'm curious to know if this could have affected my behavior or mental development in any way, as I know some types of tumors can cause changes in people. I know I could ask my doctor's again, but a.) they weren't sure before, so I wanted to check with other doctors and b.) I'm kind of lazy haha.

The nurse said I was being a worried first time mother, over the phone and said she was fine. I literally watched her 24/7 until about 3 days later she started to come around. In my reading I found that DTAP can be a little harder than prevnar or MenC vaccines, so at the next visit I skipped DTAP and did those. She did not even react to those 2 vaccines. After this I just stopped. (I know I know) 

Before all this happened I was very pro-vaccine. I used to be a quality control chemist for a pharmaceutical manufacturer and even dabbled in R&D. Let me also add that I am very auto-immune. To the point of almost dying twice. I have also had rare reactions to medications like drug induced lupus to remicade and anaphylaxis to codeine. I am allergic to several medications and antibiotics. Big pharma products have hurt me, but they have also saved my life. Being in and out of hospitals I have seen the good and the bad in the healthcare system. Currently I am in 100% remission thanks to stelara. 

And I have never been sure of my decision to stop shots and I have been relying on herd immunity while I figure it out. I want to protect her, but I also fear that she will become autoimmune.

2. Doctors are so universally brainwashed that they don't mind putting their own children at risk.  
3. This group of people is very much aware of the importance of vaccination, both for their children, and for society, and do so out of thoughtful consideration of the risks and benefits, concluding that the benefits massively outweigh the risks.

I’ll also add that many doctors make the mistake of piling on more scientific information to convince a vaccine hesitant parent.  Not only does it not work, it actually causes further entrenchment in fear of vaccines.

Appeals to emotion are far more effective (even though we as doctors instinctively see these as being somewhat manipulative): “Aren’t you worried about your child getting a scary disease?” “Don’t you want to do your part to protect vulnerable children that can’t be vaccinated?”","Answer: It's understandable that you're hesitant due to past experiences, but the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, and your daughter's healthcare provider is supportive of your concerns. Consider discussing your autoimmune history and medication sensitivities with your doctor to determine the best approach for her vaccination schedule.",False,0.17218544,16.220561224489813,17.083367346938775,18.7741
37426,Surgeon wants to remove my 12yo’s gallbladder to see if it helps with abdominal pain,"My daughter is 12 and has had abdominal pain for almost five months (since October). It started as general discomfort (she called it a stomach ache), but it has progressed to severe pain over the months. She had been having a period (started in April), but that stopped when the abdominal pain started. Other symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, irritability (but that could be related to puberty), and now depression. She had bloodwork done on 11/12/19 (see numbers below).

About two and a half years ago (two years before these symptoms presented), she had a fever for several days that spiked at 104. The ER performed a CT scan that revealed an enlarged liver and a horseshoe kidney. There was no known cause of the fever, but they got it down and released her the next day. She had bloodwork done on 8/26/17 (see numbers below).

Her 15yo brother was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis when he was 13yo, but her endoscopy didn’t reveal corrugated muscosa or symptoms similar to EoE or anything that would indicate Celiac, ulcer, or H Pylori. She had an ultrasound of her gallbladder that didn’t show gallstones, and a HIDA scan didn’t seem to indicate anything too terribly wrong. Her GI suggested a hyperkinetic gallbladder and put her on two medications that didn’t seem to help (although her period started back for the short time she was on that medication \[2 weeks\]). 

She was referred to a pediatric surgeon who is saying it could be biliary dyskinesia and wants to remove the gallbladder. I think the issue with the gallbladder is because of an underlying condition or cause. I suspected hereditary hemochromatosis when she cut her finger and put it in her mouth, saying the blood tasted more metallic than usual. I’m a carrier of a genetic variant for HH, but her ferritin levels (36.7 ng/mL) are in the lower part of the normal range (10-291 ng/mL). I was 99.99% sure it was HH, but the bloodwork came back “normal” this morning. She had bloodwork done on 2/26/20 (see numbers below).

I really think the problem she is having with her gallbladder is a symptom of something else, but I can’t figure out what. I’m so frustrated that she’s been in so much pain and for so long.

Next morning when I woke up my body temperature was slightly higher than normal, but much better than the day before. My neck was feeling very sore and it was getting worse to the point where I couldn't tilt my head. In 2 hours the pain began spreading on my shoulders, hour later - my middle back, 2 hours later - my waist and kidney area on my back. It was likely the worst pain in my life, I called an ambulance and was taken to ER. They shrugged, took a blood test and gave me Diclofenac, which helped me with pain and I was able to sleep.

All I see are questions about getting the booster and flu shot at same time. Trying to find answer and reasoning regarding timing of getting them at separate times.

Most everything I read says it's ok to get them together, but we didn't have the option at the time, but want our other vaccines as soon as it is safe or recommended to do so since we are around a lot of sick patients and will also be travelling soon. 

We both went to local pharmacy for the other vaccine and were told in both circumstances by pharmacist to wait two weeks. Didn't question or argue with him, but I can't find any CDC guidelines on amount of time to wait after receiving covid booster to get flu shot, or after flu shot to get the booster. 

Contacted employer to ask, they said contact your primary physician. I contacted mine regarding wait time for flu shot, couldn't actually discuss but one line answer was 3-4 weeks. Contacted another pharmacist with same question, said no need to wait and come on in since neither one interferes with the other.

Contacted another pharmacist with same question, said no need to wait and come on in since neither one interferes with the other.

8726,"Likely colon cancer... Liver legions, Normal liver enzymes in blood test?","My brother is a 40 year old white male, approx 6' and 170 lbs. He was hospitalized because he was unable to pass a movement for 4+ days (he doesn't remember exactly) and hadn't peed in over 24 hours. A CT Scan with contrast revealed a mass in his lower right (abdomen I think) which the doctors have all said they believe to be colon cancer, but could also be rectal. I thought they were the same thing. Colonoscopy and biopsy is happening tomorrow.

They also said that he had legions on his liver but that his liver function was normal according to his blood work. So my question is, basically, if it is colon cancer, does the normal liver test indicate that it hasn't spread to his liver? I forget which test was done that showed a high level of something that indicates colon cancer, but it did. His white blood cells have also been very high over the past week. 

He has only been complaining about abdominal pain, constipation and the inability to empty his bladder for about a week. His only other health concern has been high blood pressure for the past three or four years, which lowered after he separated from his wife, 8 months ago. But recently, it has been fluctuating wildly and he has mentioned dizziness. 

Thank you in advance for reading and responding,
Seriously scared little sister. ","I'm sorry to hear that your family has had some concerning news about your brothers health, I do wish your brother and all of you all the best for the future.

Regarding your question:
- Unfortunately liver function tests don't measure liver function well. The tests that make up the ""liver function test"" panel provide information about damage to liver cells. The liver has quite a lot of reserve capacity built in, and because of the livers reserve there can be a lot of liver damage before the tests move out of the normal range. Normal liver tests doesn't mean your brother doesn't have anything wrong with his liver at this point I'm afraid.

25509,Please help me I'm scared to death,"Hello, I'm new to reddit and this sub, so I'm not sure if this might be breaking any rules, please forgive me if it is.

I'm a medical student from India, and I'm scared to death my mom has Corona, pretty much near to tears. I'll try to tell how it started as detailed as possible, kindly bear with me.
My mom -- 49 yrs
Female
73 kgs weight
5'9 height
Past h/o bronchitis exacerbations for which she uses a salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler.

I'm posting a TLDR below, but if possible try read the longer version, I've included a lot of past h/o in there.

TLDR : 1. My mom(49yrs, 73 kgs, 5'9) has had a PRODUCTIVE cough since 4 days. The cough is typically exacerbated severely whenever she lays down to sleep, and when she inhales dust/smoke. Rest of the time, she does cough but infrequently. It was productive since the beginning, and since yesterday it's sometimes coming out yellow colored, before that it was white. Not associated with wheezing/chestpain. 

2. She has fever, highest touching 102 (only once)about 2 days ago, but since then varying between 99 to 100.8 F. THE WEIRD THING - she doesn't feel feverish at all, I don't feel like her body is warm when I feel her forehead, but the thermometer is showing high temps. 

3. SHE HAS HAD NO H/O FATIGUE/MYALGIA/DIARRHEA/DYSPNEA/CHEST PAIN. SHE FEELS COMPLETELY FIT - AND IS ABLY TO DO ALL HOUSEHOLD CHORES. ONLY SYMPTOMS RIGHT NOW ARE PRODUCTIVE COUGHING EXACERBATED ON LAYING DOWN AND FEVER, THOUGH SHE DID HAVE A HEADACHE AND SLIGHT EYE BURN AND SOME CHILLS FOR ONE DAY ONLY WHICH CAME DOWN IN A FEW HOURS A WEEK
 

4. (PAST H/O)----- She's had bronchitis since a decade for which she uses a inhaler (salmeterol and fluticasone) whenever it exacerbates.

My three questions --
a) Is it possible it's just an exacerbation of her bronchitis? I'm scared because her coughing has been particularly severe - more than her normal exacerbations. 

b) She's using the inhaler right now twice a day , and I'm worried it might cause a pneumonia if the cause of her coughing is corona/ other viruses as it causes immunosuppression. Is this a valid concern? I'm not experienced enough in the medical field for this, I'd be happy if someone answers.

c) finally, could it be corona? I know it's near impossible to tell without a test or actually seeing the patient. But all she has is productive cough and fever. No SOB/Myalgia/ weakness. What's your personal opinion?


THE ACTUAL STORY::
It started last week, when she went to a party of close friends(none of whom so far have any symptoms as far as she knows, nor any h/o foreign travel), and she ate ice cream (a lot i think) she came home and said I think my nose feels a bit blocked. This happened on 16th.

On 17th -- no symptoms, except for a stuffed nose. She didn't complain of fever/cough

Same on 18th and 19th

On 20th she started having headache due to sinusitis, and a runny nose. No fever still

It all started on the evening of 21st.

21st evening - mom started coughing. It was productive cough, right from the beginning. And she had a 100.2 F fever.  she had chills which stopped in a few hours. 

22nd -- still coughing, and fever spiked to 102.4 F. No chills. She had a mild migraine and complained that her eyes were kind of uncomfortable. Note - the sinusitis and runny nose disappeared. 

23 -- coughing. Fever came down to 100 F again. She no longer had a headache/burning eye/chills. Only two symptoms were fever with a WET cough on sleeping.

24 -- the cough increased in severity. However, here's the weird part -- when I touched my mom's forehead to check the temperature, it felt NORMAL. however, throughout the day, thermometer showed a reading varying between 99 to 101.5 F. My mom herself doesn't feel feverish/hot at all - it's just the thermometer reading driving me mad. And yes it's working fine - I tested it on myself and it showed normal temperature.

25 -- the coughing has only increased in intensity. And the weird temperature thing remains the same -- I don't feel that her forehead's warm, my mom doesn't feel feverish, yet the thermometer shows fever. 

Btw the rest of my family - my dad, brother and me are completely fine. No symptoms for anyone.

RIGHT NOW MY MOM IS COMPLETELY STABLE. No chest pain/SOB. vitals are normal except temperature.

Right now I've put her on a cough syrup(Ambroxol), Amoxicillin and Paracetamol. She's however also using the inhaler with salmeterol and fluticasone - and that's the only thing which seems to relieve the cough.

I'll repeat my questions already typed above ::

My three questions --
a) Is it possible it's just an exacerbation of her bronchitis? I'm scared because her coughing has been particularly severe - more than her normal exacerbations. 

b) She's using the inhaler right now twice a day , and I'm worried it might cause a pneumonia if the cause of her coughing is corona/ other viruses as it causes immunosuppression. Is this a valid concern? I'm not experienced enough in the medical field for this, I'd be happy if someone answers.

I'll be extremely grateful to anyone who answers this 🙏. I understand as a med student it's impossible to give proper advice without looking at the patients/tests, but I hope I'll get a bit of a feedback as to what do you think. The only reason I posted here was because I felt it would be better to get a bit of input from much more experienced docs.

And yes I would love to take her to the hospital, but I'm very worried I'd only expose her to much more dangerous infections there needlessly. I will take her anyways if it comes to that. But I don't want to take that jump and needlessly expose her to Corona. My dad's high risk too - 60yrs, diabetic, hypertensive with CAD. I shiver to think what would happen if I needlessly expose them to Corona, so I'm being extremely careful. Sorry if it sounds stupid, but I love them too much. 

Again, Thanks a lot to anyone who replies ❤️ I've been scared to death, haven't slept for a few days, every response means a lot to me.



EDIT : No one's probably going to see this but mom's fine now ❤️ her fever's gone down completely, and the cough is like 80% gone, she just feels a bit tired from all the coughing. I did a good thing not taking her to the hospital in this pandemic. I'll take her to the hospital anyways after this chaos gets over, since it seemed like a very severe exacerbation of bronchitis and the physician may like to change her meds.



Thanks again to who replied to me, it really helped soothe my fears 🤗","There is no reason to be scared to death about this. It sounds like your mom definitely has something, and it's possibly COVID-19, but the important thing is that she's doing fine right now.

A: Yes, it could just be an exacerbation of her bronchitis. That should be treated the same way you would treat another exacerbation.

B: no, not a valid concern. The steroid in her inhaler isn't going to cause significant immunosuppression.

C: Yes, could be COVID.

As long as she is not having hypoxia or markedly increased work of breathing, she's fine to stay at home, and is probably safest that way.","Please help me I'm scared to death

I had L4-5 fused because my disc herniated after having a microdiscectomy 4 months prior;  after a lot of PT and tears, the pain went away and I slowly went back to running. This is my first marathon since I did Boston in 2019.

I'm in the long run phase of my training now; there are 3 20 mile runs in my program and I'm supposed to do one tomorrow but I may knock it back to 18 (I already did one 20 miler a couple weeks ago and was fine).

I bought a new pair of shoes for running, a month ago (Adidas Solar Glide). I did this because I was getting shin splints with the previous pair. So, I went to a store get my leg analyzed (for pronation) to get the right shoe . The store lady was kind enough to test my leg and made me stand on a platform which apparently maps the pressure points on my feet. It turned out that I was an overpronator and also put most of my weight on the right leg. She suggested the Adidas solar glide, and also recommended that I use it with these insoles which make my feet tilt to the left (both left and right insoles make the feet tilt to the left) so that I put more weight on my left leg. Using this combination, I have noticed that the shin pain has disappeared, but after every run, I experience pain in my left leg(4-5 on a scale of 10), starting from the outside hip to the outside of the knee and sometimes, in the inner thigh.

My face was numb above the left side of my lip and part of my cheek, as well as both of my temples. I felt like I had pins and needles in my head. 

I texted my friend that came with me to the library and she found me on the floor in the stall. My whole body was locking up more and more. Eventually I was able to stand and drink some water from the sink, and right away I projectile vomited into the toilet. 10 mins later I was feeling a little less weak and the eye twitching stopped so we walked back to my car.

Pls i need answers its been scaring me for years and i dont want to be blind by the age of 21.","Answer: High myopia (like your prescription) can increase the risk of eye problems, such as retinal detachment or glaucoma, but the likelihood of going blind is relatively low, especially with proper eye care and regular check-ups. However, the risk of your prescription stabilizing or worsening is higher, and it's essential to monitor your condition closely.

33412,Teenage male with vague postprandial symptoms,"Hey! I’m a teenage male as the title suggests (also aspiring physician haha). 2 month history of postprandial discomfort that can probably be best described as fullness. No other symptoms (no fatigue, unexplained weight loss, fever, nausea/vomiting). CBC+BMP ordered by my family physician was normal. No H. pylori infection present. My family physician prescribed 15mg of lansoprazole qd which has had moderate benefit. Abdominal ultrasound was normal. I’m concerned for gastric cancer as PPIs tend to mask symptoms of gastric cancer. MALToma is ruled out because of lack of H. pylori? Possibly early adenocarcinoma? I would love to get some thoughts about it from medical professionals. I will probably get another appointment after I'm finished the lansoprazole if things don't clear up. Probably just some sort of FGID but I will always be at least slightly nervous until an endoscopy or upper GI series comes back normal",Unlikely that you would have gastric cancer at this point. Most likely having acid reflux which can cause a fullness/bloated sensation which is why the PPI is helping.

Do you have a clue which type of illness could it be?
I don´t know which is my illness yet, so maybe you can help me to identify it. 

Age: 23
Sex: male
Height: 169 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Race: latin
Duration of complaint: 3 months
Location (Geographic and on body): London
Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): had 2 pneumothorax
Current medications (if any): none

In August 2019 I started having headache and eye ache after using the phone in the dark the night before. I took some days off away from screens. The outside natural light created mild eye ache and discomfort. Fluorescent lighting and screens were intolerable.

Over the next ten months, I continued to work using blue light filters on the screen.

On July 2020 I was working late on the laptop when I felt pain behind the eyes but I continued working wearing sunglasses. By the end of the week, I felt very strong pain in the head and eyes and have not used an electronic device since. During the subsequent week, I felt mild to moderate pain inside of the head, on the back of the head, inside the eyes and the back of the eyes. These pains sometimes lasted for a few seconds or a few minutes and would come and go throughout the day.

Suddenly the headaches seemed to disappeared, and I had eye pain only for about three weeks, however after about one month of total abstinence from screen use the symptoms are still present.

I have been in bed with a blind fold day and night for a month. However I still feel the same burning and aching sensation behind the eyes, and sometimes I feel a dull ache inside the eyes. I also see flickering like flashes of light or may also appear in a wave pattern.

I have also experienced ear pain in the last few months and nausea when in the car. I have seen four ophthalmologists and all of them found no problems with my eyes. I also had a MRI and everything looks normal. 

I appreciate all the information you can give me!

Hello, I would like to ask something about the efficacy of different vaccine brands and their relevance to the immune system of the person being injected with it. My mother stated that since I ""have a strong immune system"" I do not need a vaccine, or if really needed, a low efficacy variant will do. She heard this information from someone or somewhere else with no credibility but she insists that it is correct. Along with it, she stated that high efficacy vaccines (like Pfizer) will reduce the life-span of the person that was administered by it.

For context, in our country, the Pfizer vaccine is mostly administered to people with existing complications (comorbidity) so she's saying that I shouldn't get that one.

They think the bacteria was Streptococcus. They did a small operation to take out the moisture and everything went well for a couple of days. Over the next 3 weeks she still had high fevers of 39 degrees and they used all kinds of antibiotics even very rare ones but nothing helped to stop the fever. The doctors say its a very rare case and they need to operate to cut a piece of her lung because its affected really bad. This does not guarantee anything because the bacteria can also spread to other organs like her heart. They are not sure which bacteria it is. Also the doctors think it has to do with her immune system but she got vaccines and she reacted well on them so it is very strange. Because it is a very rare case the doctors are kinda clueless how to help this young kid.

I ask this here because I hope someone knows something about this and can give some advice. I live in Belgium and doctors have not a lot of experience with these kind of illnesses but maybe in other countries they do. Please ask me questions if you need more information.","I’m sorry this is happening. It is definitely really hard when there are no definitive answers. 

I work in the microbiology lab. I tell your doctors what the bacteria (or other) we find so that they can treat more effectively. 

I don’t know a lot about the clinical side, but I can tell you that normally respiratory samples we get are usually sputum or a lavage (they “wash” the lung and send us the fluid that is washed out). Normally these samples are sufficient to diagnose a cause of pneumonia. 

The problem is that bacteria are very good at hiding. If they are not on the surfaces of the lung or if they form a barrier to protect themselves (biofilm, abscess), then it may be much harder to recover the bacteria on a lavage. In those cases it may be necessary also to take a piece of the lung itself so we can grind the tissue and try to release the bacteria to grow it so we can get some answers. 

Of course, they could be doing the surgery to remove the infection before it can spread. There are also things other than bacteria that can cause pneumonia that will not appear on a culture unless specifically requested (mold, mycobacterium such as tuberculosis, viruses).

I know this isn’t a definitive answer but it may explain why they are unable to get answers and why a surgery to remove some of the lung may get you closer to those answers. I hope this clears up and that things go okay.","3F severe bacteria at lungs and needs to remove a piece of lungs.

Hello. I was wondering what some key differences to look for when trying to discern between ALS and CIDP? does CIDP have to start in the legs? I know ALS is usually marked by: weakness, twitching, cramping, stiffness when limb onset but do ALS sufferers also experience the tingling and numbness that CIDP and MS sufferers experience? Also is limb onset ALS always asymmetrical at first or can it present in both hands or both feet in the early stages?

I’m asking because I have been able to find info comparing CIDP to MS but I can’t find anything comparing it to ALS. They seem shockingly similar at the onset.  

I’ve been having cramps in my hands, twitching throughout my body, perceived weakness, different manipulating object in my hands, less grip strength, tingling in my hands/feet/face and  trembling when holding objects or reaching for things. Also, these symptoms present in both hands not just one side. Thank you in advance!",I strongly suggest you stop googling.

My grandfather got his bloodwork done yesterday(as of writing this) and they called him today saying that his reading was at like 12.3 or something.

Anyways though he hasn't taken his blood thinner for 6 days now(5 days when they did the test yesterday) and his reading only went up. He's a 90 year old Caucasian male.  


He loves his sweets and his tea. And for the last week he's been having half of one of those big round cinnamon disks every night before bed. A couple hours before that he'll have some ice cream that usually has chocolate and some type of either nut, berry, or a mix. Ya'know, things like Neapolitan, Rocky Road, etc..

He's between 6'1 and 6'3 and really skinny. Like I don't think he's ever been above 200lbs before in his entire life.

About 2 weeks ago I was bitten and had a worse reaction than usual.  I got a huge area of redness and the sore was larger than usual and it oozed a lot more than usual.  It kept creating yellow crusts that were pushed out and would fall off when I rubbed them, then yellow fluid would just run down my arm.  And yeah, I couldn't resist rubbing and scratching that bugger, it itched so much.

Anyway, I've developed hives all over my body.  They wander around from the soles of my feet to my scalp, as one site fades another starts up.  I've been dosing myself with Benadryl at night to sleep and in the day I'm smearing 1% hydrocortisone all over my body.  

This happened to me last year around this time of year as well and it took about 3 weeks for the hives to stop.  Is there anything I can do to get them to go away, or at least stop itching so damn much.  They itch even with the Benadryl and hydrocortisone, it's just the benedryl knocks me out.

491,Been monitoring a brain lesion for a year now.,"I’m a 19 year old female. So I had 2 seizures in February (which may have been due to heavy use of Xanax, which i fortunately do not partake in anymore ) 
those seizures lead me to discovering a 5 mm lesion on my left anterior temporal lobe
I’ve had about 7 mris this year and every time the neurosurgeon tells me it’s the exact same. 
I’m always so flustered i forget to ask him
So what’s the plan? What’s the course of treatment? Get mris for the rest of my life and monitor it until one day it maybe grows? The last appointment he said he can’t guarantee it will grow or stay the same ...... how long is that statement valid for like at what point is it growing out of the picture ? I also feel like i have begun to notice a small bump on my left side above my ear an inch and maybe forward towards my eye two inches. I don’t think this has been here forever just noticed maybe 3 weeks ago so i thought for sure this mri would say it had gotten bigger 
I had an mri 2 days ago and here were the results of this one 

CLINICAL INDICATION:  G93.9. Small nonenhancing lesion anterior medial left
temporal lobe. Patient is currently pregnant.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial spin-echo T1-weighted, axial fast spin-echo
T2-weighted, FLAIR, diffusion, and gradient echo imaging. Gadolinium not
administered, patient is pregnant.
COMPARISON: None.
FINDINGS: Again seen is the small 5 mm nonenhancing lesion in the anterior
medial left temporal lobe, overall no change in size or imaging characteristics.

anyone know what I’m in for?","There is a good chance it's related to your seizures, it's probably a developmental anomaly or scar from an old injury (probably during development or birth).

45806,How far apart to space out taking Adderall IR & Sertraline (Zoloft)?,"My Background Info:
- 27F; 5'7; ~140lbs; Caucasian; non-smoker/non-recreational drug user/non-drinker; no history of physical medical issues; recent diagnosis of ""Baby Blues""/ PPD

Main Concern: 
never taken an SSRI before & concerned about potential side effects from taking prescriptions too close together (see below)

Prescription History:
I've been taking Adderall 20mg IR (instant release) three times per day for several years, but  just recently have also been prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft) 25mg. I haven't started taking it yet, but plan to start tomorrow. 

My doctor only suggested I take the Sertraline in the evening in case it makes me sleepy, but said it can also be taken in the morning. I've read about taking the two medications too close together potentially causing Serotonin Syndrome. My doctor did not mention this or seem concerned about taking both, but Google made me nervous. 

Possibly relevant info to add:
- I typically take the first Adderall IR (20mg) between 8-10a, second between 12-2p and the third between 3-5p (depending on my work schedule  that day)
- I work full time typically from 730a-430p, but sometimes later (depending on the day)
- I have 2 kids under 2 years, so that sometimes throws off my sleep schedule/stress levels (lol)
- I take Vitamin C (1000mg), magnesium (100-200mg), & fish oil supplements, and sometimes Melatonin (3mg) at night.

I was wondering if there's an ideal way to space out my medications so that they still work effectively while decreasing the risk of SS or any other potential negative side effects as much as possible. 

Personal experiences from people taking the same prescriptions would be a plus, but all info/advice is welcome.

I got it either the 16th or the 17th, before I left, and I have no idea what it is.

Things that I suspect:
-there were mosquitos on the night of the 16th, they came after it rained that morning

-I got a large tattoo on my left calf on the 14th, but no red ink

-I got sunburnt all over my arms and face on the 13th, but it was practically healed by the 17th, and this is just randomly here","Consider adding the rest of the required information as detailed in the sidebar.

25133,I suspect my mother (f47) is abusing her prescription medication.,"Sex: female
Age: 47
Height: 5'4"" 
Weight: unsure but definitely obese
Race: white
Primary complaint: suspected drug abuse
Duration: 6 months+
Current medications: prednisone (unsure of dosage) hydromorphone (suspect being abused) some kind of anti depressant, high doses of Advil nighttime extra strength... unsure of any others. 
Medical conditions: lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression

I apologize about the formatting as I am on mobile and quite upset. I am using a throwaway for privacy. 

As in the title I (F26) suspect that my mother (F47) is addicted and abusing her prescription dilaudid (hydromorphone). 

A bit of background. My mother lives with my husband and I. About 10 years ago she was diagnosed with Lupus, with few other chronic illnesses (rheumatoid arthritis) this leads her to be in a quite high amount of pain. Fairly recently, (last 2 years or so) Her doctor has prescribed her with hydromorphone to keep her pain under control. 

Over the last few months we have come to suspect that she is at the very least misusing her medication if not straight up abusing it. 

Signs which lead us to believe she is abusing her medication:

We hear snorting sounds coming from her room several times a day, several large snorts at a time followed by smaller ones. 

She has nosebleeds on an almost daily basis. When asked about the nose bleeds, she mentions she has ""ulcers"" in her nose causing them to bleed.

 We find bloody q-tips in the garbage. She appears ""high"". Blood shot eyes, pupils don't dilate properly.

she is tired all the time, craving sugar all the time. Passes out various areas in the house, sometimes with blueish lips

 lies about money & asks to borrow money. (She is on disability due to her Lupus)

Her hygiene is deplorable. She will go several days without a shower. She reeks of urine and sweat so badly it lingers on our fabric couch for ages. We have to wash out couch covers/ use fabreeze very often. 

Along with this she is taking way to many Advil nighttime extra strength. We have witnessed her use an entire bottle of 40 pills over the course of less than a week and a half.

 She also binge drinks, consuming 1 or 2 large bottles of wine over the course of a weekend. 

Obviously she needs to get help. She is danger and our lives are miserable living with this. We have no idea how to approach dealing with this situation. 

I appreciate any and all advice.","Yup, she's hitting some of the earmarks of ""opioid use disorder.""

Something to keep in mind is that prescription opioid abuse often involves obtaining additional drugs from multiple doctors who may not communicate with each other, so it's important to get a sense of how much she has on hand.  If someone has multiple bottles simultaneously, the odds of overdose are much higher.  

First of all, her doctor prescribing her Dilaudid at all for chronic pain is not standard of care, and this is a frequently abused narcotic.  As such, your best step is to get her enrolled in a multidisciplinary pain clinic that will try other modalities (psychotherapy, SSRIs/SNRIs, physical therapy) rather than more dangerous things like opioids.","I suspect my mother (f47) is abusing her prescription medication.

To preface this I’ve already gone to a doctor and they told me I didn’t have anything serious going on. I’ve posted in the medical subreddit too and a few others told me nothing to be worried about.

17901,"32YOM, cervical spine issues for the past 5 years+ (recent MRI with progressive degeneration). Looking for advice on treatment/management options?","Not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask, but I figured I would just give it a shot to see if there are any opinions I could get regarding a recent cervical MRI I had. I'm trying to \*avoid\* going to opioid pain meds or anything like that, so I'm sure I will need a physical therapist. I'm also hoping to avoid surgery, but given the nature of the degeneration, I am not sure how much of it can purely be fixed with physical therapy. 

Quick background before I get into the MRI results/analysis from the radiologist; Over the past 8-12 months, I have been experiencing more issues than usual. For years now, I have had a lot of built-up stress in my neck and I have had cervical degeneration primarily around C3-C5. But more recently, it has gotten so bad to the point where my entire trapezius, from the back of my skull down to my ribcage, will occasionally feel like it's being stabbed with pins and needles. 800mg of ibuprofen and 1300mg of acetaminophen have not done much at all to lessen the pain or mitigate it, and I try to use heat wraps occasionally which \*sometimes\* help. But overall, the inflammation and pain have been significantly worse, and it has affected my quality of life and my work. Some days, it even leads to numbness and tingling in my left fingers and toes specifically. 

I work in a community pharmacy setting, standing on my feet all day and as a taller male, I'm hunched over a lot folding labels, counting pills, looking at screens, etc. My posture overall has been bad for a while and I know that working for as long as I have has not helped either.

Now for the MRI results, I'm just going to copy and paste the report.

Thanks in advance, really looking for some helpful advice or guidance here!",Have you had physical therapy? I would start there to help strengthen the muscles around your spine.,"32YOM, cervical spine issues for the past 5 years+ (recent MRI with progressive degeneration). Looking for advice on treatment/management options?

Not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask, but I figured I would just give it a shot to see if there are any opinions I could get regarding a recent cervical MRI I had. I'm trying to \*avoid\* going to opioid pain meds or anything like that, so I'm sure I will need a physical therapist. I'm also hoping to avoid surgery, but given the nature of the degeneration, I am not sure how much of it can purely be fixed with physical therapy. 

Quick background before I get into the MRI results/analysis from the radiologist; Over the past 8-12 months, I have been experiencing more issues than usual. For years now, I have had a lot of built-up stress in my neck and I have had cervical degeneration primarily around C3-C5. But more recently, it has gotten so bad to the point where my entire trapezius, from the back of my skull down to my ribcage, will occasionally feel like it's being stabbed with pins and needles. 800mg of ibuprofen and 1300mg of acetaminophen have not done much at all to lessen the pain or mitigate it, and I try to use heat wraps occasionally which \*sometimes\* help. But overall, the inflammation and pain have been significantly worse, and it has affected my quality of life and my work. Some days, it even leads to numbness and tingling in my left fingers and toes specifically. 

I work in a community pharmacy setting, standing on my feet all day and as a taller male, I'm hunched over a lot folding labels, counting pills, looking at screens, etc. My posture overall has been bad for a while and I know that working for as long as I have has not helped either. 

&#x200B;

Now for the MRI results, I'm just going to copy and paste the report.

On Saturday I would like to go out with some friends, and this will probably involve a couple of beers (will actually be my first time out of the house except for Doc and PT appointments since the injury). I don't want the alcohol to interact badly with the painkiller.

I'm a 35 year old male, around 6'3"" (190cm) and weigh about 190/85kgs.","This is one of those things you have to play by ear. 

The reason opioids and alcohol are bad together is because they indirectly synergize. If you take a percocet, wait 20 minutes, and drink a single beer, that one beer is going to feel like 6. You will feel *very* drunk, very fast. The drunkness will also wear off as quickly as one beer, not six.

Speaking from experience and not from my medical education, I'd give it at *least* six hours. Even then, start by drinking very slowly and make sure you're not getting trashed or disoriented from a single beer. You should not drink the amount you're normally accustomed to.

The danger is from not expecting anything, drinking a lot, and going comatose. You can over-do the alcohol and hit respiratory depression in a hurry. If you give it several hours and then carefully monitor how the alcohol makes you feel, you'll be okay.","How long should I wait before drinking after taking a percocet?

&#x200B;

I am a 22 year old female. Mixed race, native and white. I am 5'3 and about 110lbs.

I have been having migraines since I can remember. I remember once my mom having to pick me up from a friends house when I was a child because I was in excruciating head pain. I must have been 5 or 6 years old. Every month or so I get a migraine, which can last for a day, or a week. I've been hospitalized multiple times for migraines, I have tried every single pain medication I can think of. The longest I have ever had a migraine was 7 days straight.

T3s, Naproxen, Advil, Tylenol, I have had steroid shots, Benadryl, IVs. Sometimes they stop for a couple months, but they always come back, and the symptoms are completely unpredictable. Sometimes it's just the aura and a headache, other times my face and arm goes numb and I can hardly see for hours, my head pounds, I vomit and get nausea, my mind gets slow. Currently I am not on any medications, and I have never had an MRI or spinal tap. One time at the hospital the doctor mentioned I should get tested for MS.  Each time I mention my migraines to a GP, I just get told to take 1500mgs of Advil and deal with it.

This has destroyed my life for as long as I can remember. I had to take weeks off of high school, and I am terrified this will destroy my career. Yesterday I got a migraine at work. I work in enforcement so this is extremely unsafe. I forgot to do something very important during my shift because of how out of it I was. I am going to university in the spring and because of this I'm finally at the point where I am desperate to combat this.

I have tried cambia, I have been on anti seizure medication, a handful of antidepressants, and recently I have began smoking marijuana for this. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. They never stop. They are always back, and doctors never take me seriously in person. This causes me so much anxiety and depression. It feels like I can't live a normal life. It's just doses of normality in between horrendous and debilitating pain. It's torture.","Have you been offered any of the 'triptan' group of drugs?

These are now the standard treatment for migraines and can abort a migraine with very good efficacy.

You might ask for, for example, sumatriptan. There are a range of triptans and I'm surprised no one has offered you them if you have definite migraines.

Look [Here ]( for details of British recommendations for migraine treatment. It's a bit technical but you will get the important points even if some of it doesn't make sense. 

Edit : migraines can be diagnosed clinically. You don't need an mri or a lumbar picture or any of that. Your description sounds convincing. I would need to talk to you in person but I expect you would leave with a prescription and I wouldn't require any samples or scans.

6013,Syncope concern with heart problems.,"Hello I'm a 25 year old Caucasian male of 6' and 220lbs, living with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (ef of 15-20%) and stage 1 PKD. I also have a subcutaneous ICD for tachycardia. 

I'm concerned the medication I am on has heightened my chance of syncope significantly as 4 of the 5 lower my BP.
I'm currently on:

Torsemide 20mg 3x per day

Spironolactone 20mg 1x per day

Digoxin .125mg 1x per day

Lisinopril 25mg 1x per day

Carvedilol 12.5 2x per day

Three weeks ago I had surgery on my foot and ankle.

I’m looking for some affirmation that this is okay! It’s the area between where the sutures were and the actual incision. This is a sore spot because my splint rubbed on it pretty hard, and there’s usually pressure on it now because of my walking boot. I’m still nwb for another three weeks, and I use a wheel chair to get around my house and care for my kids.

Something similar happened with my knee surgery. There was a spot where the staples were that just turned into a big nasty scab. It did heal after some tlc. 



Does this look okay? Should I tape a gauze pad over it to reduce friction? I’m allowed to get it wet, but at this point I’m thinking I need to keep my foot dry so this heals faster.

Sometimes she’s mid walking and has to stop and drop into the closest seat and grab her stomach. 

  This morning she felt she couldn’t even get out of bed, and when she did she threw up from the pain. She hasn’t been sleeping at all because she’s up all night complaining about pain. Every time she eats she throws up because the nausea. 

Her last doctor appointment was 2 weeks ago and they said “lightning crotch” was normal and it’s all normal. 

But this isn’t lightning crotch, it’s like she’s getting ran over by a train at random. I’ve seen her litterally fall to the floor from it. Is this normal!?","Answer: This severe and debilitating pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, is not normal for a 36-week pregnant woman.

12575,EKG shows sinus arrhythmia and short PR interval,"i am 18F and i went to urgent care today after an anxiety attack got me terrified that i was having a heart attack. my upper left chest hurt, a pulling type of pain that was briefly stabbing. my hands went stiff and tingly, and so did my face. 

they did an EKG and it showed some minor abnormalities. it showed that i had a short PR interval (112 ms) and minor sinus arrhythmia. it also said the ekg did not show any significant abnormalities. 

the doctor at urgent care told me that it was nothing too terribly abnormal. but if my symptoms (pulling at my chest) persist, i should go to the ER (which like, wow) or my cardiologist. i also have POTS, which has recently flared up again after about two years of dormancy. 

basically, i just wanna know what this EKG result means and what it could possibly be indicative of. 

also worth mentioning: i recently stopped cymbalta.

thank you","There are a few conditions that cause a short PR interval. The most common is wolf Parkinson white syndrome but there are a few others.

These are generally asymptomatic and don’t cause a problem in most patients who have them. But patients are at higher risk of having occasional fast irregular heart rates.

&#x200B;

I'm a male in my early 30s. Never had back pain beyond rare soreness in my life. Right now there is a terrible sharp pain in my lower back that hurts constantly, but much more so when I move, and it does hurt to the touch as well. I can barely bend or twist, and once when I touched the area with my hand my knees gave out for a split second. This pain has been persistent for two and a half days so far.

&#x200B;

No health insurance, very poor, paycheck to paycheck.

&#x200B;

So my question is: since I only have a little over $100 in excess of my bills this month, what do I do? I cannot afford a GP + referral. I don't have a primary and wouldn't be able to get in to see one for weeks anyway. My gut tells me to go to a chiro, but I'd like opinions from people more knowledgeable than I am.","Not a doctor. You didn’t include required medical info.
Your cheapest option is to start gentle stretching, OTC pain meds, ice/heat to see if it’s a regular ol strain. You need to get it to relax in order to try to start moving it and resolve the pain.

Chiropractors can be great and can be horrible and have a mixed reputation. Imaging may not be especially useful, bc there is some evidence that “back pain” is not always directly linked to imaging abnormalities, so sometimes you have pain and no abnormalities, sometimes you have no pain and end up seeing abnormalities (if you have another reason to scan the back), and sometimes you have pain and abnormalities that are not connected. 

The most effective use of limited funds might be going to outpatient PT.","Sudden, terrible, first-time back pain.

I had pneumonia from Nov 17 until roughly Dec 19. I have scoliosis, costochondritis, anxiety, depression, and other random ailments that probably aren't related. I've never had a history of asthma or any lung issues before the pneumonia, though I do get chronic sinus infections.

Last week I had a pulmonary function test done (see [this previous post]( for more information) as well as an arterial blood test. Below are my blood results:

Results | Value | Reference
---------|----------|----------
**Total oxygen content** | **17.3 ML/DL** | **18-22**
Sodium, serum or plasma | 137 MMOL/L | 135-148
Potassium, arterial blood | 4.4 mmol/L | 3.5-5.3
Position | SITTING | N/A

Patient temp | 37.0 CELCIUS | N/A
Oxyhemoglobin as percent of arterial blood hemoglobin | 97.2 % | 92.0-99.0

Hemoglobin, arterial blood, total | 12.5 g/dL | 12.0-15.0
Hematocrit, arterial blood | 37% | 36-55
Fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) | 21% | 21-100
Carboxyhemoglobin as percent of arterial blood hemoglobin | 0.8% | 0.0-1.5

Barometric Pressure | 742 mmHg | N/A
Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient | 7 (?) | N/A
Allens | YES | N/A

As shown above, my total oxygen content is low, pH is high, and carbon dioxide is low. My PFT results were good (I think) other than a low RV (50% predicted).

&#x200B;

So I am having warts on my fingers treated at the dermatologist. We decided to go with the Candida injections which I guess are some kind of yeast antigen that tricks the body into fighting off that + the warts. The first treatment was 2 weeks ago, I had one injection into the large wart on my right thumb knuckle. It didn't swell up anywhere as bad, and certainly not for a few days afterwards.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I had my second round, same wart received the injection, except this time my entire thumb is very swollen and there is a warm to the touch red rash that has spread a bit up to my hand.

&#x200B;

These are twelve hours apart:

I've been taking Advil and icing it but it doesn't seem to do much.

&#x200B;

Any ideas? It doesn't really hurt (or throb), it's just swollen, sore if I apply pressure to it, and is very warm to the touch.

I also noticed this red rash mid arm but I don't know if it's related. It definitely wasn't there yesterday.

38317,Sprained hand question - happened today. Is it worth calling an ambulance for it so they can splint it immediately?,"Information:

21yr old male, non-smoker. Approximately 64kgs and 176cm height. Medications: 25mg Atenolol, 200mg Lamotrigine (morning & night), Pantropazole 40mg, Celecoxib 100mg.

Past medical history: Too much to name, however I did injure the same hand when I was about 8, and have had a (slightly) limited range of motion in it since. E.g. I can't move all the fingers independently of each other, especially my ring finger and pinky.

-

Story: So today I hit my hand against a wall and I'm pretty sure I sprained it. It started out as only in my pinky finger but now my whole hand and wrist is hurting? It's been about an hour since it happened.

I don't know how bad this is (I assume minor), since there's no pain or swelling yet. I've read online that you should wait 24 - 48 hrs to apply a splint. Is this true? I only found one website stating it so I'm pretty confused.

Anyway, my question is - should I bother calling an ambulance so they can splint it? Or would they refuse since it hasn't been enough time (or other reasons)?

Luckily I have free ambulance visits since I have private health insurance, so I'm not worried about the cost.

I'm a bit of an anxious person and right now I'm having difficulty taking my mind off the injury, especially since it seems to affected my whole hand (and even my wrist to some extent).

Thanks in advance for any responses I may receive.

I had my gallbladder taken out in May after experiencing severe symptoms. For about 2 months after that, I was doing very well. No pain, no nausea, normal bowel movements, etc. In July, I started experiencing persistent diarrhea that lasted a few weeks. Then one night I got hit pretty bad with nausea and ended up vomiting several times.

Since then, I've been experiencing both abdominal pain and nausea off and on. After about a month or so of dealing with that, I also started experiencing fatigue, fevers, elevated heart rate, and heartburn/acid reflux. The abdominal pain has been pretty much gone for the past few weeks due to having to eat very light, but the other symptoms have gotten worse. I went to the ER a few weeks ago feeling like I was going to pass out and told them this and they tested my blood, urine and stool. Everything came back normal. He gave me some Imodium and Zofran and sent me on my way.

2 weeks ago I had my physical, all is well.  The nurse couldn't find my vein in my arm so she drew blood from the top of my left hand.  This resulted in swelling and pain above the vein that lasted a few days but no obvious bruising.  A few days later I did have slight discoloration on my skin...yellowish, which I know is the body reabsorbing the blood.  

The past two days I have awoken to pain and swelling on my forearm just above my wrist, centrally.  No bruising although it is tender and sore as if it was a bruise. The pain radiates on and off into the top of my hand and my arm has the sensation of feeling cold on the inside around the area too, like I had a bit of ice under my skin as crazy as that sounds.  My whole arm is a bit sore.

But the strangest thing is a vein in my wrist under above my thumb in my wrist popped out, like a little bubble and is very obviously pumping and pulsating...none of my other veins in either wrists is doing this, I have never seen it do this before.  In fact, I feel like I have never noticed this vein being there before, it popped up next to my other vein that travels into my thumb.

Maybe I have watched too many episodes of House, but this is odd because I have not been exerting myself and have not banged my hand or arm at all.  Could this be related to the hand veinipuncture I had done 2 weeks ago?

White, living in the US (SC)

I’ve been dealing with painful sex ever since I started having it three years ago, and I have had more doctors appointments than I can count looking for answers.

I recently had a pelvic MRI, and when the report came back showing adenomyosis, I thought I might finally have my answer. Yet my gyn says that he doesn’t think it’s the cause.

Can someone please give a second opinion?

For reference, my pain is a deep, almost bruise-like pain that occurs with deep penetration. It does not hurt with all types of penetration (e.g. tampons are fine), it’s just when certain areas are pressed on. It never hurts unless it’s actively being provoked.

Previous tests:

I had an exploratory laparoscopy that was completely clean and ruled out endometriosis. I had a cystoscopy with hydrodistension that showed bleeding (don’t remember the technical term) and led to a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis, though I didn’t see any improvement in the pain with medications for that (I tried several), and I also don’t deal with other typical IC issues (frequency, urgency, etc). I did pelvic floor therapy for six weeks, where they told me from the beginning that I had a strong kegel and a strong relax, and I didn’t see any improvement over six weeks (my gyn was not surprised by this since he said there were not any noticeable issues with my pelvic floor function). Various other scans have not shown any other issues (cysts, fibroids, etc). Birth control greatly manages my periods, but it has no effect on the pain with sex (tried several kinds). I’ve tried muscle relaxants, anti-depressants for nerve pain, topical lidocaine, and the old “have a glass of wine first” strategy. Nothing has made any difference.

If it’s relevant, I also have EDS (hypermobile type) and Sjogren’s Syndrome, though my doctors don’t seem to think those are related. The SS causes dryness, but lube fixes that issue easily enough.

Please help, I’m really at the end of my rope here. I really thought adenomyosis might be the explanation.

[Link to report & doctor’s notes](","What I'd take from that MRI report is that you have the *bare* minimum necessary to diagnose adenomyosis (which is 12 mm focal thickening of the junctional zone, but without any other more specific features), a condition that is commonly-enough seen in asymptomatic patients by ultrasound and MRI that it usually doesn't even make it to the impression of the report (but in this case the radiologist didn't have anything else to talk about). 

[This paper]( is a few years old, but I'm not sure there's anything more recent that specifically adresses (isolated) adenomyosis and deep dyspareunia:

> Endometriosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, and interstitial cystitis have been associated with deep dyspareunia. Although medical therapies may improve deep dyspareunia in women with endometriosis, laparoscopic excision of deep endometriotic lesions has been demonstrated to improve not only deep dyspareunia but also the quality of sex life. Deep dyspareunia related to the presence of pelvic congestion syndrome should be treated by pelvic vein embolization. Intravesical therapy may be effective in treating deep dyspareunia in women with interstitial cystitis. It remains unclear **whether** uterine myomas and **adenomyosis are causes of deep dyspareunia**.

Discussed [here]( (a PDF of the entire article is available; its actually really good and only a few pages) is that hormonal treatment *is* a mainstay in treatment of symptomatic adenomyosis. 

So it's possible that your gyn is concluding that since you don't have anything but a minimal and likely incidental 'diagnosis' of adenomyosis, and since BC seems to do a very good job with your periods in general but does nothing to your main symptom, that it is unlikely (but not impossibly) to be related.","MRI showed adenomyosis (report attached), but doc says that it’s unlikely to be the cause of my pain with sex.

9648,Question about my son's depression and meds,"  My son, 18 y.o, White,  6'2"", approx 180lbs, complaint since June 18th, no previous hx of any mental health issues, physically healthy. Sustained a head injury on June 18th, he tripped and hit the front of his head on foot lockers at the end of bunk beds while in recruit training at Parris Island, SC. Experienced memory loss, headache, vision issues(blurred and double), and confusion. He was also told he had a panic attack which he does not remember. During this time he was also sick with bronchitis/pneumonia and flu and had been up for extreme amounts of time, close to 100 hours with about 6-8 hours of sleep total. He was ultimately taken to a behavioral health hospital in Georgia sometime after the injury and spent a week as an inpatient, because after the head injury he was having suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and felt depressed.  I do not know how long it took him to get to the behavioral health hospital because he was also seen in medical on base, and another hospital before being sent to the BHH, so it could have been several hours, the drive from Parris Island to the hospital was about an hour itself, which I imagine would have heightened any anxiety. He recognized that these thoughts weren't normal so he actually opted to go to the BHH voluntarily, rather than go back to base and sit in medical, he wasn't forced to go.  Spent a week in the hospital where he was prescribed Zoloft 25mg 2x a day as well as Vistaril for anxiety, before being sent back to base where he spent an additional 2 weeks in the separation platoon before being released and sent home. 
      He has been home since July 13th and has seen a counselor, and a PA who works with psychiatrists who switched his Zoloft dosage to 100mg once a day and kept his Vistaril dosage the same but added Seroquel to help him sleep 25-50mg. His memory is returning and he has no vision, confusion, headaches and his personality seems to be returning as well. We aren't having any luck with neuro, no one in our area sees patients that are post head injury so I am thinking about trying to obtain a referral to someone in a neighboring city and also looking at getting him into a Neuropsych as well. His problem seems to be getting to sleep and the Seroquel doesn't seem to be addressing this, he takes it at 9 or 10pm and it is still a couple of hours before he falls asleep, I should add that he normally never slept a full 8 hours unless he was sick, about 6 hours is his norm.  He did start taking his Zoloft in the morning around 9am instead the evening since Zoloft can cause sleep issues, he made this switch on Saturday so just a couple of days.  
     What I'm looking for help with is, what things can he do regarding his meds to help his sleep, I'm not a fan of the Seroquel due to some of the side effects, so is there something else that he could be prescribed short term for help with sleep? and also, is this sort of thing common after a head injury, the depression and and anxiety, and how long would it normally last and need to be treated with meds, and what things can he do now to help the recovery process?

","As long as the depression/anxiety isn't deemed to be very severe/major the current guidelines determines that CBT is equally effective as antidepressant medication, so maybe you can ask if he can be referred to a therapist instead of continued medication.","Question about my son's depression and meds

  My son, 18 y.o, White,  6'2"", approx 180lbs, complaint since June 18th, no previous hx of any mental health issues, physically healthy. Sustained a head injury on June 18th, he tripped and hit the front of his head on foot lockers at the end of bunk beds while in recruit training at Parris Island, SC. Experienced memory loss, headache, vision issues(blurred and double), and confusion. He was also told he had a panic attack which he does not remember. During this time he was also sick with bronchitis/pneumonia and flu and had been up for extreme amounts of time, close to 100 hours with about 6-8 hours of sleep total. He was ultimately taken to a behavioral health hospital in Georgia sometime after the injury and spent a week as an inpatient, because after the head injury he was having suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and felt depressed.  I do not know how long it took him to get to the behavioral health hospital because he was also seen in medical on base, and another hospital before being sent to the BHH, so it could have been several hours, the drive from Parris Island to the hospital was about an hour itself, which I imagine would have heightened any anxiety. He recognized that these thoughts weren't normal so he actually opted to go to the BHH voluntarily, rather than go back to base and sit in medical, he wasn't forced to go.  Spent a week in the hospital where he was prescribed Zoloft 25mg 2x a day as well as Vistaril for anxiety, before being sent back to base where he spent an additional 2 weeks in the separation platoon before being released and sent home. 
      He has been home since July 13th and has seen a counselor, and a PA who works with psychiatrists who switched his Zoloft dosage to 100mg once a day and kept his Vistaril dosage the same but added Seroquel to help him sleep 25-50mg. His memory is returning and he has no vision, confusion, headaches and his personality seems to be returning as well. We aren't having any luck with neuro, no one in our area sees patients that are post head injury so I am thinking about trying to obtain a referral to someone in a neighboring city and also looking at getting him into a Neuropsych as well. His problem seems to be getting to sleep and the Seroquel doesn't seem to be addressing this, he takes it at 9 or 10pm and it is still a couple of hours before he falls asleep, I should add that he normally never slept a full 8 hours unless he was sick, about 6 hours is his norm.  He did start taking his Zoloft in the morning around 9am instead the evening since Zoloft can cause sleep issues, he made this switch on Saturday so just a couple of days.  
     What I'm looking for help with is, what things can he do regarding his meds to help his sleep, I'm not a fan of the Seroquel due to some of the side effects, so is there something else that he could be prescribed short term for help with sleep? and also, is this sort of thing common after a head injury, the depression and and anxiety, and how long would it normally last and need to be treated with meds, and what things can he do now to help the recovery process? He has the ability to re enlist in 2 years so he really wants to get this issue addressed and be able to get off his meds so this can happen.
     Hope this is enough info, if not, please let me know and I'll try to supply additional details.","Answer: Considering your son's history of head injury, depression, and anxiety, it's common for individuals to experience sleep disturbances, depression, and anxiety in the short-term (weeks to months) following a head injury. In this case, the use of Seroquel for sleep may be continued short-term, but alternative options like melatonin, a sleep-promoting supplement, or a low-dose trazodone (a medication that can help with sleep without significant side effects) could be considered. Additionally, establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding screens before bedtime, and engaging in relaxing activities before sleep may also help improve sleep quality.

Also if I’m feeling better later I won’t take the Xanax. My first instinct is always not to take benzos unless the depression/anxiety are so debilitating that I can’t function. Today is one of those days.

I have been diagnosed  with severe panic disorder without agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. I’ve had these mental disorders for the past 40 years, been in talk therapy mostly but since my hormones started going wacky I now take xanax only as needed.

898,Low hemoglobin! 25F,"Basics: 25F, 350lbs/5’8, PCOS, pre-diabetes (fasting cbg just over 100), depression, anxiety, strict vegetarian (no supplements)

Meds: lamictal and klonopin 

Situation: Today I went to donate blood. Found my hemoglobin to be a lil low, 9.8. 

For the past week I’d been loading up on iron heavy foods because I thought my levels might be a little bit low. I thought several tons of spinach and more soy than a body should have would give me the boost I needed to be, like, 13 or something more reasonable so I’d qualify (stupid, yes, but I’m high key desperate for that sweet antibody test). 

Of note: I’ve been feeling like absolute trash for the last chunk of my life. Incredibly low mood/energy, more frequently episodes of depersonalization/realization, and a general constant dizzy/far-away feeling. There are many instances I feel like I’m going to pass out if I stand too quickly or sit in one place too long. I assumed this was due to my blood sugar or something insignificant and let it pass. 
I also have frequent chest pain. Every strip they’ve run is normal. My rhythm is great. I’ve learned anemia can cause this. Previously thought to be anxiety. Maybe a combination? 

I don’t have heavy periods (they are rare and light) and this would be the first time I’ve donated blood. 

Now that I know I’m rather anemic, I’m a bit concerned with the symptoms I’ve been having. Getting out of bed is hard.  Living is hard. I am exhausted constantly and find myself falling asleep or able to fall asleep damn near anywhere. 

I’m wondering if a lot of my crappy mood could be due to my body being derived of oxygenated blood, maybe? I feel like a lot of my health is likely linked to the anemia that’s likely due to me being a really terrible vegetarian. 

Questions: 
1.) Can a hemoglobin of 9.8 be safely managed at home with a daily dose of 65mg iron and maybe a change in diet? Along with tracking of my general feeling of health? 

2.) Do I need to be worried? It isn’t classified as severe anemia at this time, but I think if I were to have my levels tested after reverting back to my not so iron heavy diet that it could potentially be much lower. 
I’ve reached out to my health clinic for an appointment but no one has gotten back to me. Do I need to go into an urgent care? Or am I alright to wait potentially weeks for an appointment?

I have been kind of shrugged off at drs. office. They say my lymph nodes aren't concerning and all of my dozen or so blood tests have come back normal, minus the mild eosinophilia recently. I have had no fever (but I feel like I have one), no night sweats, no itching, no noticeable weight loss, no anemia. I do have some fatigue here and there. All of my previous inflammation tests (crp/sed) are basically at non-existent levels. No detected autoimmune conditions. I was worried about possible colon cancer so took CEA test which was under .5 (knowing this isn't used to diagnose cancer). Going back in tomorrow to re-do blood work and get my LDH tested.

35695,My ankle hates me and I'm wondering if an orthopedic surgeon has any opinions or recommendations for me (26f),"I had 3 surgeries on my left ankle at age 15 (2008) - first was modified Brattstrom (sp) ligament weave; second was opening, cleaning and removal of infected tissue and bone three months later due to a MRSA infection that was caused by nonsterile vicryl sutures and the MRSA got into the outer layer of my bone and became osteomyelitis (never presented with any swelling, only pain and an oozing spot); third surgery was arthroscopic debridement of the joint from spraining it again later that same year. (I also had two surgeries on my right foot but that's not relevant to my current situation)
My left ankle has been severely unstable since then. I've been through 4 years of physical therapy, they said my muscles are as strong as they're going to get and the instability is not really fixable unless they do more surgery (graft ligaments from thigh/wrist or synthetic ligaments) which I haven't done. I have rolled it many times over the past 11 years, but nothing severe and it's always healed on its own. Yesterday, I stepped out of our trailer while I was cleaning it, stepped on a pebble the size of a quarter without realizing it, and down I went. Instant pain and swelling (see above - swelling is unusual for my ankle). I walked on it all day because I was hoping it was a sprain or something, but it got bigger and bigger as the day went by... So last night I went to the ER here, they did a CT scan, and I got an avulsion fracture of the lateral malleolus and a torn aclp (not positive if that's the correct acronym) ligament. Currently in a walking boot, I'm a stay at home mom of a 9 month old girl and can't afford to be completely off my feet if I can avoid it. It's in a significant amount of pain, they gave me ibuprofen and acetaminophen as a combination to alleviate said pain (it does not help at all, just slightly brings down the swelling) and I'm waiting for the ortho office in town to call me back to schedule an appointment.
So my point of this post is to hopefully get a few opinions, thoughts, reactions and/or recommendations... I understand that this is in no way a doctor-patient relationship, just hoping to have a chat with an ortho surgeon or anyone familiar with the horror more commonly known as an ankle.

8274,32M Growth on Right Kidney,"Hi Guys,
I was in for ultrasound to check liver condition due to my UC. I am currently only on salofalk with no problems. That went well; however they inadvertently discovered a mass on my right kidney that is 6.8cmx3.4cmx4.2cm.

We just had our son end of March and this was a big blow to our positive life. 

All I want to know is what are the different type of scenarios that could occur and what is the best and worst case scenario?

I don’t have any symptoms except a little tightening in the abdominal. I was on suppléments créatine and bcaas for a few years. I noticed a bit of blood in the stools when I would load those supplements together after my workout. I’ve recently stopped it and just on bcaas and glutamine. No issues since. 

Please share your thoughts...I’d just like an idea as to the different scenarios? What’s the best and worst case? Is it treatable? What’s the survival rate? Will it effect my life span? What do you think this sounds like?

Also would the ultrasound also have detected if the growth had spread to other organs or lymph-nodes?

Thank you so much for your time!","Ultrasound is a good screening study, but won't give the more important information that we need to better understand the mass as well as the possibility for spread of disease.

You will definitely need a CT scan, and that will give you the information you're looking for.

Obviously, amassed this size is scary and concerning, but at your age there is a reasonable possibility of the mass being benign. Possibly an oncocytoma. Of course, there's also the possibility of this being a renal cell carcinoma.

Best case scenario is that you have surgery and it shows a benign tumor and you're done. Worst case scenario is that the CT scan shows spread of disease and cure is not possible.

If it is a kidney cancer, there is a good likelihood, assuming the CT scan shows no evidence of spread, that surgery will cure you. If the CT scan shows spread then typically cure won't be possible.

Most likely, you will have a long and normal life after this despite this setback.","32M Growth on Right Kidney

43215,Unhappy Balls (m28),"Around Thanksgiving, I noticed a mild burning sensation when I urinated. Not painful, but noticeable. I also noticed I was having trouble emptying my bladder all the way.

Maybe a week later I started having horrible pains in my lower back, on the left side (which have since stopped). Like a tremendous amount of pressure.

Shortly after that, I started getting pain in my balls. The pain ranges from uncomfortable, to nauseating. It comes on randomly and leaves just as randomly. Sometimes laying flat on my back helps a bit. Sometimes it doesn't.

Since the start of burning pee, I've been STD tested twice (once on my own, once at the direction of my doctor who insisted on another test), both tests detected no STDs, had a urinalysis to check for UTI that came back normal and an ultrasound on my balls that showed nothing interesting. Doctor thought the back pain was coincidental.

Most recently I've noticed that when I cum, barely anything comes out. I mean like one drop that drips out after the muscle contractions are done. Before this started happening, my wife and I would joke about me having a ""supersoaker"". 

This has pretty much fucked over my life. Random ball pain, mixed with basically no cum has messed up my self-esteem. The pain makes it hard to do anything beyond lay in my recliner, on my back and watch Netflix. Prior to the ball pain, I was running 6 miles a day and lifting. Both things are out of the question now, as I can never tell when I'm going to feel like a ghost has kicked me in the testicles.

The only medication I take is Welbutrin at 300mg a day. The only other physical health problem I've had, was some degenerative disk disease that caused a lot of pain 3-4 years ago, which was treated with radio frequency ablation.

If anyone knows what's wrong with me or what I should do next, I'd be grateful.

33533,"My [17M, 5’9”, 160lbs.] temperature has been fluctuating from between 97.9 F to 103.8 F even since my negative COVID-19 test on Friday...","Hi all, I am a 5’9” 17M white male weighing 160lbs., I go to school in Boston, MA, where we get tested for COVID-19 every three days. Friday morning at 8:00 AM I went to go get tested for COVID-19. I went back to my dorm, hung around my room a little, and took a nap, falling asleep around 11:30 AM (I have a weird sleep schedule).

I woke up at 5:30PM on Friday because I had plans to go out to dinner at 7:45 PM with two friends (masks, social distancing, we all have to test every 3 days). I must mention that in Boston it was about 41 degrees this night and I was wearing a T-Shirt, a long sleeved shirt, a light jacket with no hood, jeans, socks, and slides. I was shivering the entire way to the restaurant (1 mile walk—it was also here that I teceived my negative COVID-19 diagnosis via emal) throughout dinner (1 hour), a quick detour to Target (it was heated in here at least), and the mile-walk back. At this point it was about 11:00 PM and I immediately went to bed as I was freezing my butt off.

Saturday morning I wake up at 11:00 AM with body aches, a light headache, and alternating chills/heat flashes. I check my temperature and it’s a whopping 102.4 degrees. Panicking, I tried to schedule a COVID-19 test at my school in case I got a false negative, but the school forbids symptomatic students from getting a test at the regular center. All symptomatic students must report to the symptomatic testing center, which is closed on the weekends. I’m kind of just stuck in my dorm for two days until Monday when I’m able to receive a test at the symptomatic test center. Since Saturday morning I’ve been taking brief naps on and off where every time I wake up I check my temperature my temperature has fluctuated from anywhere and everywhere between 97.9 Fahrenheit to a whopping 103.8 degrees. I’ve been taking plenty of fluids (water/Gatorade dropped off by my friends), acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and eating when I feel like it. As I write this post, my temperature is at 102.7 F. I’m still unable to get tested for COVID until tomorrow morning, but I’m worried I’m not going to make it that far. Is there a chance this is something else, such as hypothermia, the flu, thyroid condition (maybe I can’t control my own body temperature anymore?) I only ask because not only am I missing the classic COVID-19 symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, sore throat, etc. but I only have a light headache bodyaches and chills/heat flashes from the fever.

Measured by BP and It was 155/90

I removed the devices and tried calming down. Heart rate settled below 100 in 2-3 hours. Got my ecg done but nothing came out

Started feeling quite anxious from then on. Was always thinking about why the heart rate was high. After 2 days while having dinner i felt my heart racing suddenly and checking my watch saw it going up from  82 to 178. It settled soon enough in like 10 mins

In both these incidents i did not feel any pain or breathlessness

Post this i consulted a cardiologist. Again got my ecg/echo done along with all the blood tests 
All tests were normal   Even got a holter done for 24 hrs but it was normal too

Cardiologist said that it was driven by anxiety and some acidity issues. So he put me on metrorolol for 20 days

42461,Right testicle discomfort.,"Male 25, 160lbs, 5’10. 



I’ve been experiencing testicular discomfort since the start of this month. 

Started with my left testicle but quickly moved on (lasted one day) to the right testicle (no left testicular discomfort since). 

It feels like there’s a tube /vein/something attached at the top back of the my right testicle that gives me discomfort, occasionally a little pain.  And that tube seems to go up and about an inch above my penis to the right. 

I’ve been having a lot of abdominal pain since March and I made an appointment with my doctor and mentioned the testicular discomfort so he said he’d check them out at the appointment but then we both forgot about it and my balls weren’t checked for lumps or anything. 

However, When I went to the ER a couple weeks ago for an abdominal thing, the doctor decided to checked my testicles for hernias but I guess he didn’t find anything wrong with them because he said he didn’t find anything. 

Sometimes I don’t feel the discomfort for a couple days but it always comes back then disappears again. 

I emailed my doctor to make another appointment to get this checked out. 

But can anyone tell me what this might be? I was thinking cancer but they didn’t find any bumps. 

(My abdominal pain I was dealing since March is gone). 

I haven’t been working out or anything. 

No sexual activity since the lock down began mid March so my boys aren’t being smashed or anything.

I was tested for STDs and various herpes in April (stopped having sex in mid March) and came up negative for everything.",Torsion unlikely. Hydrocele possible as well as epididymitis,"Right testicle discomfort.

Ped ordered lumbar x-Ray and bloodwork, all normal. By the next week, it had rapidly progressed to severe muscle pain in both calves and thighs, and pretty extreme tremors/shaking. He started sleeping on the floor with his feet elevated on the couch. He saw an ortho doc who prescribed pt, and saw a chiropractor, both thought it was from the spine. They prescribed naproxen 500mg which didn’t help. The next week the pain worsened, we went to the local ER twice, they gave him a Gatorade for dehydration the first time, nothing else. Said stay the course with pt. Second time they gave him oxy in the ER and sent him home with some hydrocodone, neither helped. By now (2nd week) his left leg gave out with every step and he needed crutches, I had to buy them myself because no one prescribed them, but said they might help. Week 3, pain is an 8, constant. One night he started screaming when our kitten ran across his leg and wouldn’t stop, so we went to a children’s ER nearby. He was given 4 doses of Fentanyl and admitted. After his first dose of fentanyl he started sobbing from the relief, but every time it wore off that night he got this hopeless look in his eyes. The next day they gave him torridol and Tylenol, pain went up to 6-7. Discharged with 100 mg 3x daily of gabapentin, and ibuprofen. During this stay he had EMG, MRI of the spine, spine and hip x-rays, urinalysis, and lots of bloodwork. Everything was normal except d-Dimer which was double (little over 1000) so they did ultrasound of his legs, normal. Also hip x-Ray showed a small bony bump on one hip, said it’s unrelated. In the hospital he had consults with ortho, neuro, and psych. Ortho dropped us saying it’s not surgical, pediatrician switched us to a better PT with a water and zero g treadmill, nothing else. Past medical history- diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome at age 9, also mild gastroparesis and decreased intestinal transit time. Seems to be growing out of CVS has not had an episode in over a year. Has seen a great counselor regularly since age 9 to help with cvs issues, and had a full psych eval in August by a children’s psychiatrist because returning to school caused anxiety due to 4 previous years dealing with CVS at school, started on 20mg lexapro and doing great, homeschooling anyway due to covid. I have a feeling doctors write it of as psychological as soon as they see that he’s on lexapro. Sorry for the long post trying to give a thorough history! We are both getting very discouraged and I hate seeing him in constant pain! He can’t take a single step without crutches, had to buy him a shower chair, sleeps in a recliner with lots of pillows under his legs, and can’t take steps even with crutches, keeps his legs together and kind of hops. He was able to walk on the zero g treadmill at pt yesterday, gait was abnormal. TIA for any help!","Psychosomatic disorders are real, it's not the same thing as malingering. The treatment is therapy and sometimes psychotropic medications.

Also I didn't say it's the only differential, just the most likely.

One night he started screaming when our kitten ran across his leg and wouldn’t stop, so we went to a children’s ER nearby. He was given 4 doses of Fentanyl and admitted. After his first dose of fentanyl he started sobbing from the relief, but every time it wore off that night he got this hopeless look in his eyes. The next day they gave him torridol and Tylenol, pain went up to 6-7. Discharged with 100 mg 3x daily of gabapentin, and ibuprofen. During this stay he had EMG, MRI of the spine, spine and hip x-rays, urinalysis, and lots of bloodwork. Everything was normal except d-Dimer which was double (little over 1000) so they did ultrasound of his legs, normal. Also hip x-Ray showed a small bony bump on one hip, said it’s unrelated. In the hospital he had consults with ortho, neuro, and psych. Ortho dropped us saying it’s not surgical, pediatrician switched us to a better PT with a water and zero g treadmill, nothing else. Past medical history- diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome at age 9, also mild gastroparesis and decreased intestinal transit time. Seems to be growing out of CVS has not had an episode in over a year. Has seen a great counselor regularly since age 9 to help with cvs issues, and had a full psych eval in August by a children’s psychiatrist because returning to school caused anxiety due to 4 previous years dealing with CVS at school, started on 20mg lexapro and doing great, homeschooling anyway due to covid. I have a feeling doctors write it of as psychological as soon as they see that he’s on lexapro. Sorry for the long post trying to give a thorough history! We are both getting very discouraged and I hate seeing him in constant pain! He can’t take a single step without crutches, had to buy him a shower chair, sleeps in a recliner with lots of pillows under his legs, and can’t take steps even with crutches, keeps his legs together and kind of hops. He was able to walk on the zero g treadmill at pt yesterday, gait was abnormal.

8893,At what age should parents leave the room for their child’s checkup?,"I’m a 17 year old male who recently went in for an annual sports physical. My normal doctor is currently on vacation so I had the appointment with a different woman who I had never met before. Normally when I have an appointment my doctor has my mom leave the room before she asks me personal questions about sexual history, orientation, drug use, mental health, etc. but the new doctor asked me all these questions with my mom present in the room. When she began asking about past drug use I got uncomfortable because the truth is I have tried marijuana in the past school year but I didn’t feel comfortable admitting that in front of my mom so I ended up lying and saying no. I feel bad about lying to a doctor because I know I shouldn’t do that but I didn’t feel like having THAT conversation with my mom on the way home. When it got to be time to check my testicles for hernias that’s when I finally asked if my mom could step outside but the doctor insisted that she needed to be in the room as a “chaperone”. I told her that ever since I became a teenager my usual doctor has always asked my mom to leave for the check, but she told me that since I was a minor she legally needs my mom to be present, and if my regular doctor has had my mom leave then she was “bending the rules”. So that’s where I put my foot down because let’s be real, I’m 17 and don’t feel like taking my pants off in front of my mom. The doc told me that I didn’t have to do the check, but in order for her to be able to clear me for sports I had to have it done, and for her to be able to do it my mom has to be a witness since I’m underage. My mom got annoyed with me and told me to stop whining and just do it, so after much arguing I finally relented and just let the doc check me in full view of her, and it was just as uncomfortable as I predicted.

So basically my essential question is was the doctor right there? I was under the impression that at my age I could give my own consent for stuff like that. She insisted that my normal doctor would have been “bending the rules” if she performed a checkup without my mom there, but that doesn’t seem right to me. I’ve donated blood in the past at school without my parent’s permission, and I just seems odd that I’d be able to consent to that on my own but not to have my own testicles checked by a medical professional. It’s just something I’m curious about for future reference and any and all information would be appreciated.

Thanks!","That's absurd. I start asking parents to leave the room for at least part of the visit around age 11-12, depending on the kid. It is sometimes  practice to have someone else in the room as a chaperone for the genital exam, but I bring a nurse or medical assistant in to do that, not a parent.

Sounds as though this doctor isn't familiar with how teenage pediatric visits are generally done.

Hello, thanks for reading.

I am a 24 year old male, and have had a laundry list of issues over the last few years. Please.. please give me suggestions, or let someone read this who might have ideas.

First of all, for a little backstory, i wrote this post here ( [ ) about a year and a half ago. And nothing has gotten better, if anything much worse.

For the past two years i have had bad neck and back pain for seemingly no reason, that has just gotten worse and worse. This was coupled with feeling exhausted, out of it mentally (like im just not all the way there and feeling like I can only really use my brain at like 60%). In january I was in a car accident, and that really flared my back pain up so I figured it was time to go to get it checked out. I had a CT scan done, which cam back all good on my neck down to I believe my tailbone. But theres a kicker, they found a golf ball sized mass in my chest. Fantastic. Had that biopsied, and thank the lord it came back as negative, but it was a granuloma caused by histoplasmosis. The doctor claimed it was by far the biggest he had ever seen. I then went to an infectious disease doctor to see if i still had histoplasmosis, which he insisted there was no way I did. Test results come in, boom, still active. I take an anti fungle for 6 weeks, and thats that. On that medicine i felt absolutley horrible. Like I didnt know who I was or what was going on. Im getting better now, but it was terrible. Fast forward a few months, and I got an MRI of my back to try to follow up on the issue that this started with, the back pain. MRI is all good, BUT (arent all these buts fantastic?), they find two more lymph nodes that are ""extremely enlarged"" (A couple CM each way I think?). Sweet. So I have more enlarged lymph nodes, feel like im literally dying, and everyone swears up and down that im not sick, and Im just being crazy. So I take it upon myself to schedule and appouintment with that same infectious disease doctor and see if these newly found lymph nodes are concerning to him. I know he is a busy man, but he basically laughed me out of his office and two minutes, and told me not to bother him anymore and that he is ""confident he gave me the proper treatment"". Now as one might imagine, this whole process basically sent me mind into a spiral, because at that point I did some reflection on how bad I really truly feel. I am not myself. I am not who I was a few years ago. I am slow. I am sluggish. I feel awful all of the time. I just feel completely out of it. You know how when you feel really sick, and the day just kind of passes by and you remember it.. but not really? That is everyday. I cant breathe. My back hurts. My neck and throat are so swollen. At this point I can hear my neck and back just crackling and popping as I move. My hips, ankles, elbows, shoulders all just crack and make noises. I randomly just start sweating and feeling like i am going to pass out. I cant think straight. I just feel mentally and physically exhausted. And like i said, I didnt realize how bad it was because It happened so slowly and I just became accustomed to it. My blood pressure has been extremely high. And a lot of times I feel like my heart just starts pounding and I can feel it skip beats. It has not been out of the ordinary to have a resting heart beat between 140-150. I feel like when I sleep I just black out. Dreams arent vivid. Its like I remember them but I dont. I dont feel rested. It doesnt feel like sleep. It feels like everyday just runs together. I have endless amounts of blood test done that have ALL came back fine. Like literally every single one in the normal boundaries. My PCP even said basically theres no more tests to do on you. They are all fine. I feel like ive seen 18420345234 doctors, and no one wants to really dig deep so they just toss me out and say its anxiety or something mental. I know its not. Thats not who I am. Im not an anxious person. I might be anxious now, but thats because I am scared and I am getting no answers.

I just dont know what to do.. Honestly. I just want to cry. i dont want to live like this anymore. I just want to be me and enjoy my early 20s. I feel like I have lost two years of my life. So please.. Any suggestions are greatly, greatly appreciated. I tried to add what I could here. But it is all so much to remember off of the top of my head that im sure I forgot some things. So if you have anymore questions, please ask. Thanks guys, it means the world.","That sounds really frustrating. If it were happening to me, I would probably feel the same way.

Here is what I would recommend. Get another opinion. Find another primary care doctor. Internal medicine, family doctor. Don't try to get the smart doctor. Get someone consistent that you feel can advocate for you. 

Then when you find the one you can trust, trust them. If the problem it's physiological s/he can fix it. If it is psychological, that too can be fixed. 

You are describing some B cell symptom that can be concerning for hodgekins lymphoma. If you were my patient I'd consider a hematology consult.","Begging for help at this point.. Please help me if you can

32952,Suspected Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI),"Hi, 
First time post here, I'm hope someone out there can give their opinion on the following... 

My father, 85M has been complaining of lower leg pain for the last few days, as of yesterday his middle toe has become black, progressively more so thoughout today. 
 
See manky toe gallery here. 

[manky toe](

My dad lives in the UK. Having spoken to the GP he was told go to A and E as this was suspected CLI. Now, i didnt know anything about CLI, but Dr Google would suggest the only way from here is amputation... Idealy, the toe, not the foot or leg!

However, after many hours of waiting, my dad saw 2 doctors and has been sent home with some co-codamol and told to ""keep an eye on it"". Apparently hes had a 'scan' that shows an important artery is blocked and thats why the toe is black.

Now peeps, you have to realise, my dad is old, frail, deaf and pompous. He cant understand and remember most of what hes been told in hospital - my mother couldn't accompany him because of covid regs.

Should we start frecking out the my dads going to lose a lower limb? My gut is saying that he should never have been sent home.

Tia","Not a vascular surgeon, happy to be corrected on any of the following by someone who actually knows what they're talking about.

Looks like the beginning of dry gangrene to me. Most common cause is peripheral artery disease, where the arteries supplying your legs / feet / toes get clogged up so not enough blood gets to the extremities. The tissues downstream essentially just wither away from lack of oxygen.

The usual progression for this kind of dry gangrene would be autoamputation, where the affected tissue (in this case, his third toe) would eventually, quite literally, fall off painlessly.

I would expect his scan was some kind of CT angiogram to reveal where the blockage is. I would also expect he will be followed up and they are planning for whatever appropriate intervention they have in mind to restore blood flow. Please liaise with his GP to make sure this is the case. For now, I don't think he needs to be sent back to the hospital immediately.","Suspected Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)

I am 23
I am male
5'11
I weigh about 160ish pounds
Caucasian

Since.. around the beginning of March of this year.

Both testicles, and occasionally groin. (Above shaft, around the belt-line)

No existing medical issues, I have a terrible diet (Pizza pretty much daily, likely don't eat as much as I should, once or twice daily) But that aside I would consider myself in rather good health.

No current medications.

Okay, first off, you people are amazing. Being able to get a medical opinion without too much of a delay sounds like, I appreciate this more than I can say. Worrying while I wait for my second opinion is pretty much destroying my mental health on top of the usual stresses with studying.

For about the last.. 4, 5 months? I've noticed my libido decreasing, nothing too crazy at first. Steadily more over time, I've been busy with studying and I figured it was just a byproduct of stress, to some degree it probably was. About a month ago I noticed a small, very solid lump at the bottom, base of the left testicle.

It's about.. the size of a small pea, the GP I saw said about the size of a marble. I've been seen by a GP, and then a specialist. Gone through an ultrasound, had two rounds of blood and urine tests the week before, and the week before that.

The specialist diagnosed it as spermatocele, and while I don't necessarily doubt his diagnosis (the fellow has around 40 years of medical practice) general testimonials about his performance by seen patients is.. somewhat sketchy, particularly in comparison to the other Urologists in the medical building.

He did the general physical tests ""turn your head and cough, does it hurt when I pressure on your lower stomach, etc"", but pretty much came to the conclusion of spermatocele pretty much immediately after that, not very keen on taking feedback of how it hurts, where it hurts specifically.

my tests concluded that I'm in otherwise excellent health aside from T count being on the low end of normal, still within normal range but lower than it should be for my age.

From my own physical description, the lump itself is (irritatingly) excessively difficult to find but I'm certain it's there, the GP found it herself during my first examination. Half the time it feels like it's never ""stationary"" for long, yet when I can manage to get a hold of it it feels relatively attached to the testicle. (I move it, the testicle moves.), its location is generally on the lower left side, almost underneath the bottom of the testicle, when I can find it.

Since my second follow-up with the specialist, there's another lump on the exact leftmost side, fairly soft, fairly pliable, circular, almost like ""swelling"" (likely not, he's had me taking a metric ton of ibuprofen so I imagine that would keep swelling down)

Only other pertinent info and what's driving me bonkers, they're fucking shrinking. Particularly the one on the right that has no.. lumps or anything unusual that I can tell from a self-physical. I'm not quite ""hypochondriac"" levels of careful but I've been watching for any changes, checking daily, and four or five days ago I thought I noticed a decrease in size but decided to play it safe, probably just imagining it. Nope, definitely a pretty drastic decrease in size.

TL;DR Version
Off and on pain in both testicles, tiny lump, diagnosed as spermatocele on left. Pain is low-to-moderate, more concerned that there is any pain. Is a dull ache, sometimes a ""pulling, heavy feeling"".
Decrease in size, particularly the one on the right.
Soft, pliable swelling on the leftmost of the left, can't tell if it's the original lump with swelling over top or not.


No family history of testicular cancer, I have an appointment but it's roughly two weeks away and the dramatic loss in volume has me extremely on-edge, don't know if this worth going to the emergency room over or not.

41483,Fear that I may have had Lyme disease,"about me : 23M, 1m75, 75 kg, no recurrent treatment. Allergy to amoxicillin.

So 4 days ago I went to bath in a lake with two friends. The weather was bad so we walked in a nearby forest until the sun came back.

When we got out of the forest we found a sign ""Beware of ticks"". We then bathed in the lake and the water was pretty cold.

After this I stayed home, and the second day I started feeling sick.

I have fever and I have chills as well as very painful headache that does not fade away with paracetamol. The headache is mostly on the front of my head and both sides. Sometimes it gets pulsative. I tried putting a cold, wet towel on my head, I only felt worse. The lower part of my back hurts. I have to pee much more frequently than usual but it always comes out with a darker yellow color. I try to drink more water as a consequence but I sleep almost half of my time since 2 full days and 2 full nights. My eyes are tired. It's like having muscle ache behind my eyes.

I feel bad when I see fatty food. Anything with oil or sauce makes me feel bad (??) so I've only eaten fruits and bread in 2 days. But usually I like fat stuff too.

I have tested negative to covid 19 today and have had 2 injections since a couple months. I have no sign of a tick bite on my skin but I read on the internet that in a significant number of cases, the red spot and halo wouldn't appear. I also read that Lyme disease could easily be mistaken with an infection due to the common symptoms listed above. I'm worried. I'm going to see the doctor today and ask him if there is any chance he would provide me with antibiotics as a prevention.

My doctor gave me pristinamycin, ibuprofen and paracetamol. I'm worried because the internet says pristinamycin is almost never used for Lyme disease. I wish he gave me preventive antibiotics for Lyme instead.

sorry if there are mistakes I'm not a native english speaker.","Unless you found an engorged tick on your body, it’s highly unlikely you were bitten by one. Ticks, once latched, burrow and suck blood until engorged, which takes some time and they are usually found before they fall off. The reason Lyme is a concern is because once the tick starts feeding on your blood, it regurgitates some of its stomach contents, passing on Lyme. Even being just nipped by a tick that didn’t actually latch has next to no chance passing on Lyme. 

I wouldn’t worry from what you described.","Fear that I may have had Lyme disease

However, it would be reasonable to discuss your concerns with your doctor about Lyme disease and consider further testing or preventive treatment.
