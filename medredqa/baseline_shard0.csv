21241,29F Constant Food Poisoning/ Stomach Flu,"Hello! 

I have moved abroad to china and been here for about 4 years now. Some background information: When I arrived I was almost 110kg? I am now, over the past two years mostly, down to 70kg. I exercise 5-7 days a week and don't eat junk food or drink often. I live a low stress life, though I do work as an instructor most of the year, while going to school full time. I also have had hypothyroidism since I was 14, with a current dosage of 100mcg 5 days a week, 125mcg 2 days a week. I'm 172 cm, Caucasian. I used to smoke like... a cigarette a day two years ago, but don't now. 

I'm here because of consistent stomach flu/food poisoning that the doctors here keep telling me is me just having 'a weak stomach' and then telling me to not eat spicy food/drink more hot water/etc..

For the past year I've been getting terrible food poisoning every three months or so. It first happened when I was in a tiny village in China and ate a bit too much questionable meat and drank a few shots of baijiu (white rice wine).

I was vomiting and shitting... all the time for 7-9 days. I went to the hospital with a 39c fever consistently and was put on an IV each time. 

After that, I got sick again about a month later after eating some bread for breakfast. Similar symptoms, but only sick for a few days. 

And then again... and again...

In between this I had an odd ankle rash and they did an allergy panel. I'm allergic to milk, cats, dogs, and dust mites. Not sure if it's related, but they gave me a shot in the ass to stop the spread of the allergy (itchy red hives that went from one ankle to both ankles and started creeping up my legs). This was at night. The next morning I woke up, went to the bathroom and couldn't breathe, was seeing spots, and almost fainted. I had to lie down on the floor for a while in order to be able to breathe normally and then stand up. 

Most recently, as in two days ago, I ate dinner out with friends and almost immediately had a bad reaction. I lost feeling in both hands and was non-stop vomiting. An ambulance was called. My BP was 150/130, the nurse was in such disbelief that she kept testing my blood pressure. 

I didn't get feeling back in both my hands for almost an hour.

They did a CT scan and blood test. CT was normal, blood test had slightly raised amylase (114). They said I had food poisoning and sent me home. 

The next day I had throbbing pain under my bottom right ribs and a HORRIBLE pain in my right shoulder to spine area. The right shoulder to spine pain keeps coming back, but the under rib pain went away. 

The hospital again had me get a CT scan. Nothing. 

I've asked for an ultrasound of my gallbladder and have been told no. 

I'm really at a loss. I've never needed to go to the hospital before this past year and now I keep going back with the same problems again and again but all I get told is to not eat spicy food, not to eat oily food, drink hot water, etc..

Please help. I want to eat and go out to dinner without worrying if I'm going to lose everything inside of me for the next few days. Or go into hypertension.",Have you been tested for giardia or other parasites?,"29F Constant Food Poisoning/ Stomach Flu

In Feb this year, over the course of 1 week, I developed the following symptoms which have not subsided: 

-  sudden anxiety to the point of being sheer terror. Totally disabling. 

- cognitive issues, slurred speech, trouble finding words and getting words out, forgetful. Feeling almost like brain damage.

-  numbness in right cheek. 

-  Dizziness and feeling that brain is inflamed/vibrating 

-  swollen thyroid gland

-  swollen glands in neck/throat which changed randomly (within hours). Felt like skin is crawling. 

-  Problems swallowing/choking on food regularly 

-  Both forearms going numb

-  physically weak and clumsy. Fatigue 

-  Episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia (with fainting) . Within the space of 20 mins my heart rate can go from 140bpm to 35bpm.

I’ve seen a cardiologist who dx’d vasovagal syncope. An endocrinologist who dx’d thyroiditis and a neurologist who dx’d migraines. None of them seem able to put these pieces together and work out what the real combined cause is. All my blood work has come back either normal or inconclusive. A brain MRI was normal. I’ve tried physio/acupuncture/migraine meds with no improvement. I also developed recurrent UTI’s over the last 3 mths.

Some were inconclusive so the doctors withdrew the Gentamicin early. They told me they simply didn’t know what was wrong. I also had three episodes of Tachycardia in hospital. This time of 157bpm.

It depends on what your OBGYN defined as ""didn't vary much"". If it varies <5 bpm for a prolonged period of time, it's definitely not a good sign, but I'm guessing that if he/she sent you guys home and said he/she will monitor the fetus during delivery, it's probably a healthy fetus.

About two years ago I had a bad day, and decided foolishly to drown my sorrows by getting wasted. I have downed about 375 mL of 40% alcohol in a very short amount of time. I blacked out and later remember puking everything I drank, getting alcohol poisoning. I eventually recovered, but ever since then when I try to drink any alcohol that is 40% ethanol content, I always have a strong aversion off it when I ingest it, primarily from the smell of it. By aversion I mean the smell of it when drinking it makes me shudder involuntarily, and it's very unpleasant to swallow. I can still handle drinking the weaker alcohols like wine and beer without that issue. Can anyone explain  what neurological issue I may have?

On Thursday I woke up with coughing and a little pain on my head but it wasn’t that bad , the coughing wasn’t that extreme and today Friday i have no longer coughing but my head hurts like hell and my body, I feel really tired and I can barely focus on what I’m doing.

What is this. And i woke up without feeling scared like it was normal but inside im like ""what the fuck just happened"". Can someone please tell me what happened.

2059,How does Acetazolamide affect idiopathic intracranial hypertension? Should I expect to be on the medication long-term?,"I [28F] was referred to a neurologist who prescribed Acetazolamide to treat my recently discovered IIH (alongside other treatments and lifestyle changes), but I don't really understand how the medication works. I also don't know if I'll need to be on the medication long-term. The neurologists' bedside manner was... not the best and I didn't feel comfortable asking questions.","I’m an adult neurologist (resident). Ditto /u/sapphireminds ‘s succinct explanation as to what the drug does, and I’ll add further. This special type of diuretic helps decrease the pressure in your head. The goal of this is to thereby improve symptoms like headache, visual issues etc as well as reduce the swelling of your optic nerves (I imagine you had someone look in the back of your eyes, which usually shows papilledema aka optic nerve head/disc swelling in IIH patients) to prevent further or worsened damage to your vision. 

I don’t want to frighten you, but I did want to be clear in case the other neuro wasn’t about something critical to know about IIH. Not addressing this with weight loss and medication can potentially lead to continued damage to your optic nerves, possibly leading to long standing or even permanent vision disturbances/loss. 

With lifestyle changes and modest weight loss, many patients can be tapered down or even completely weaned off the medication. Most likely this wouldn’t be for at least several months to a year from diagnosis and treatment initiation. There are other drugs that can be added, doses adjusted, etc while working on weight loss if symptoms or papilledema worsen in spite of treatment. 

So basically, I can’t predict if you will or will not need acetazolamide for future long term use. It depends in part to how your body responds to the drug and following up with your neurologist if inadequately treated after a few weeks, to ensure optimal medical therapy for you. Ultimately weight loss is the most effective and potentially curative treatment for IIH. Much easier said than done, but it is important to try your best at losing weight, stay the course and not get discouraged since this condition takes awhile to improve, and take your medication as prescribed. And of course, don’t hesitate to look for another neurologist if the one who you initially saw didn’t click well with you.","How does Acetazolamide affect idiopathic intracranial hypertension?

Started happening a few months ago, at first i thought I was overtraining, tried to give it a few weeks of rest and got back to it, same thing. A few more weeks of rest, same thing.

I've already seen my doctor and gotten myself an emergency room bill I can't afford, stress test showed a run of pvcs before my heart rate got high and they insisted I stop (well before I got to the point the reaction occurs, felt like a total waste of time).

Cardio exercise after about 10 minutes reliably causes me to become light headed and confused, followed by a sensation of extreme temperature change and full body sweating, pain and stiffness in my neck, jaw, and left arm. I become pale and sickly looking, weak, and shaky. This has happened 3 times now, it's definitely repeatable. Started happening a few months ago, at first i thought I was overtraining, tried to give it a few weeks of rest and got back to it, same thing. A few more weeks of rest, same thing.

I've already seen my doctor and gotten myself an emergency room bill I can't afford, stress test showed a run of pvcs before my heart rate got high and they insisted I stop (well before I got to the point the reaction occurs, felt like a total waste of time).

Half year? A year? (?? nobody knows) in rehab receiving PT and OT until he is fully functioning. 

His right side was paralyzed but in these 2 days, he has learned to talk again (with slight slurring), raise his arm and moving his leg although he cannot stand yet or move his hand. This seems like a pretty good indication that he will continue to recover.

He had a panic attack episode last year which landed him in the ER. That was his first and only other time. Since he's been admitted this time, he has panic attacks often (nurse!! the ativan please!! he loves it and it really helps him sleep. Is he gonna grow dependent on that?), and is generally emotionally having an extremely difficult time. He is having a hard time accepting what is happening.

From what I've shared, can you guys tell me anything about what I can expect to happen from here? Is he going to be on disability? (I can try to find out more details if needed but I'm avoiding asking him too many questions right now. His parents tell me pieces here and there but I don't even know what I don't know.) And also what I can do to be supportive and helpful? He has no desire for any of the hobbies he usually enjoys. He is upset and feels guilty for burdening others (including me) and for being unable to go to work (think something like social work/teacher/nonprofit). To be completely honest, I would like it if he took this opportunity to find a less stressful career. But it'll be very hard to convince him of that, even despite the stroke.

Stroke recovery is most obvious for the first 3 months, less prevalent for the 3 months after that, and continues at a diminished capacity for up to a year. 

The best next place for him is a dedicated stroke rehabilitation center. Usually once everything is stable this move is quick. at inpatient rehab he may spend about 1-2 weeks depending on insurance and need. 

After is the outpatient and home stage. If he continued to need significant care, there are subacute facilities. A stay here may be up to another month. 

Speed of recovery of movement is a good predictor of overall recovery. Given he already has movement on the paretic side after 2 days, this is a good sign. Ideally he would already have started bedside physical therapy. 

There is a huge variation on symptoms depending on location of stroke and severity of condition. Generally small strokes in non key areas recover better. A rule of thumb is that strokes recover centrally to outward, so that shoulder muscles recover before hand. This appears to be the case. 

Ativan really should be avoided after strokes. At least in animal models of brain injury benzodiazepines (Ativan, Xanax, etc) have been shown to delay recovery.

Health conditions: pregnant

I’ve had for fungus for about a year now, I can’t treat it orally yet because I’m 8 months pregnant and my doctor said the medication isn’t allowed during pregnancy. 

I noticed today that on both feet it looks like my nails are shedding and have several layers.. Is this concerning? I have no other health conditions so I’m not sure how it would be beaus nails... so is this just related to the fungus? 

Thank you!! 

[toenails](","Nail fungus itself can lead to Beau’s lines, but in my opinion your picture simply depicts nail ridges horizontally. This can occur from many things, including the fungal infection itself versus nail trauma from improperly fitting shoes which happens a lot during pregnancy if you are one of the lucky moms see you have growing of the feet. I’m not sure how you are grooming the nails (at 8 months I could barely reach my feet), but no biting!  Another condition that that could be the cause is iron deficiency but ideally your prenatal vitamin should be taking care of that issue. 

I don’t think that this is something that you need to worry about, but  I would simply seek treatment after the baby is born especially if you are choosing to breast-feed. There is a laser therapy that has been on the market for a few years with good success at treating nail fungus and it would not be systemic.","Weird toenail lines please help

48182,How to get tested for oral and rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea,"19 Male, 6'1 and 160 lbs. Non-smoker.

Hello!

I had unprotected sex with another guy and I want to get tested for oral and rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia. It has been 41 days since I had sex, and I don't have any noticeable symptoms. On day 39, I got a standard STD panel with gonorrhea and chlamydia included, but the lab (Quest Diagnostics) only took a urine sample. The results were negative.

According to the CDC, the urine sample only detects urethral infections and may not pick up on infections present in the throat or rectum. For that, the CDC is recommending a swab test. Since I only got a urine test done, I'm worried that I still have a rectal or oral infection, particularly because the sex was unprotected. Can anyone give me advice on how and where to get a rectal and throat swab? I would prefer to get these in a lab or office setting instead of an at-home test. Should I just schedule a wellness visit with my PCP and ask for these tests?

Thank you for any advice!

I think I am about as physically active as I can be right now, but I know I need to work on my diet. I've been keeping a food diary for the past few weeks (I read somewhere that that's a good place to start).

I am nervous to ask for help because I personally feel embarrassed and ashamed of my current situation. and I've never felt particularly comfortable  talking about it. Is this something a doctor can even help with? What can I expect to come from this conversation?","Probably the best thing you can ask your doctor for is a referral to a dietician.

Doctors learn so much, but unfortunately nutrition and diet information isn’t something they learn in depth. But dieticians do.

The basic advice is to eat at a caloric deficit. That’s all it takes to lose weight. It is “simple” but not easy.

A dietician can help you with ideas to make that a reality. They can look at your food diary and look for high calorie/low nutrient foods that you can reduce, and suggest high nutrient/low calorie foods to take their place. They can help you develop meal plans too.

Most doctors would advise diet modifications and safe increases in activity as first line treatment for obesity. It’s the safest and most effective way. They are unlikely to prescribe medications or suggest surgery unless those lifestyle changes fail

In the meantime, you can start counting your calories. Keeping a food diary is a great start! The next step is to weigh/measure those foods and enter them into a calorie counter (MyFitnessPal is probably the most popular and is really easy to use) to see how much you are actually eating in a day.

I think I am about as physically active as I can be right now, but I know I need to work on my diet. I've been keeping a food diary for the past few weeks (I read somewhere that that's a good place to start).

I am nervous to ask for help because I personally feel embarrassed and ashamed of my current situation. and I've never felt particularly comfortable  talking about it. Is this something a doctor can even help with? What can I expect to come from this conversation?","Answer: Your doctor can provide guidance on healthy weight loss strategies, offer support, and help you set realistic goals. They may also refer you to a registered dietitian or a therapist to address any underlying emotional issues related to food and weight.

Doctors learn so much, but unfortunately nutrition and diet information isn’t something they learn in depth. But dieticians do. The basic advice is to eat at a caloric deficit. That’s all it takes to lose weight. It is “simple” but not easy. A dietician can help you with ideas to make that a reality. They can look at your food diary and look for high calorie/low nutrient foods that you can reduce, and suggest high nutrient/low calorie foods to take their place. They can help you develop meal plans too. Most doctors would advise diet modifications and safe increases in activity as first line treatment for obesity. It’s the safest and most effective way. They are unlikely to prescribe medications or suggest surgery unless those lifestyle changes fail In the meantime, you can start counting your calories. Keeping a food diary is a great start! The next step is to weigh/measure those foods and enter them into a calorie counter (MyFitnessPal is probably the most popular and is really easy to use) to see how much you are actually eating in a day. Your doctor and dietician can then help you figure out a safe and realistic calorie goal that will lead to sustainable weight loss.","Answer: Your doctor can provide guidance on healthy weight loss strategies, offer support, and help you set realistic goals.

48411,Balanitis? Sticky red penis glands (nsfw),"19yo/180lb/6'0""/Race: Hispanic,Asian/Geographic locale: Sacramento, CA>>Phoenix, AZ/ I've had this issue for at least the last two years/I've visited my GP and a urologist twice/no meds



Both times I've gone to doctors for this issue, they've brushed off my penis infection.

Howdy, I'm an uncircumcised male and I peeled back my foreskin for the first time in 2016. That was the first time I went to my general practicioner for penis problems. I told him my foreskin was too tight to fully retract outside of the shower and that I suspected I had balanitis, an infection on the head of my penis. So he referred me to a urologist. She said pulled back the skin and underneath it was horrifying. This is the first time I've really seen my penis and he wasn't doing well. Smegma scattered everywhere, a beet-red patch of skin occupying almost the entire glands. The urologist said I did have balanitis and should wash my guy with soap everyday and it would go away. 

A year passed and now its 2017. The inflammation is down and I can pull my foreskin back easier. But, according to my google research, I still have balanitis. The head still has a sticky red patch, which sticks to my foreskin, making it impossible to quickly retract my foreskin.

So I went back to the urologist and reiterated these issues. She said it's just some discoloration and I shouldn't be worried. I wanted that to be true so I took her word and left. It's now a year after THAT and I'm thinking I should deal with this infection on my penis. But how? 

Should I go to a different urologist? A dermatologist? Either is kind of difficult because unlike the last two times, I'm at university now where I don't think I have so many specialists available. Is there any home remedy I could use to take care of my issue?","First, I think that you do not understand the teminology that you are using. Balanitis can be infectious or inflammatory ('-itis' means inflammation). There are many conditions that appear like this, including plasma cell balanitis, lichen planus, psoriasis, and many other conditions. I suggest that a biopsy is indicated, and suggest you seek out care to diagnose this condition.

- **Stage** indicates the spread of a tumor: high stage cancer has metastasized; low stage cancer is localized

- **CD20** just indicates its a B-Cell lymphoma (a specific type of lymphocyte)
- **Ki67** is an indicates of cell proliferation. Basically, it measures how rapidly the cancer cells are growing. Leukemia and lymphoma both tend to have much higher Ki-67 readings than other cancers. While a high Ki67 reading does indicate a high rate of growth, it also means that those cells are *very* susceptible to chemotherapy. So assuming you're able to begin therapy promptly, a high Ki-67 is actually probably a good thing.

- **Bcl-2** is a marker for a particular type of lymphoma called Follicular Lymphoma. Yours was Bcl-2 negative, and is therefore *not* follicular lymphoma

- **CD-3 and CD-5** are just T-Cell markers (another specific type of lymphocyte). In this case, I believe the report is referencing non-cancer cells with these markers.

Fast forward to now, I’ve had a new GP who has gotten me and iron infusion and my iron levels are normal for the first time in my life. The chest pain has not gone away and I am experiencing extreme fatigue, sharp- dull/ aching chest pain that’s feels deep to left side of chest, and dizziness/ visions goes black from sit to stand (never lost consciousness). My GP decided to order an ECG And holter monitor. ECG came back with sinus bradycardia, and the holter monitor came back as the same, Bradycardia and that my heart had skipped a beat 7 times over the 24hours. My GP states she wasn’t really concerned about the results, that they are fairly normal but wasn’t sure why I was brady.

Your investigations so far sound reassuring. 
1) Treating your iron deficiency didn’t help the symptoms / pain and therefore it isn’t related to iron deficiency (although you have to be fairly anaemic to cause chest pain). 
2) You had a halter monitor that was essentially normal. Although to be honest a halter monitor is unlikely to show anything given your symptoms.

I don’t think sinus bradycardia should cause your symptoms, except perhaps the postural dizziness. 

Have you had a lying and standing blood pressure taken? This may be worth doing.
Have you had a normal 12 lead ECG (EKG)?

I'll try and keep it brief

26m

Around 5 years ago I hurt my back deadlifting. Got an x-ray and the doc said there was nothing wrong and the pain is muscular. I took some time off, but probably went back to the gym too soon. 

Fast forward to now, I hurt my back the same way 4 times in between. Deadlifting, lifting heavy objects. This puts me out of commission for about 2 weeks. My body is bent over to the left side for the first few days and can hardly walk. 

The last time this happened I picked up a 220 pound guy in a fireman carry. I went back to the doc and got another x-ray, and he said there is some degeneration in my L5S1 disk, and that I have a mild scoliosis. This doc told me to do lots of yoga. 

So it has been about two months since I last hurt my back, and I have done yoga around an hour a day (most days). I do feel better, but not 100%. I just have this weird pain still. It happens when I'm sitting down and I crunch my abs, it is strong sharp pain in my low back. 

When I go into child's pose, it is briefly painful, and the longer I hold the position. The pain slowly subsides and I feel great after. It's hard to explain. I don't know what is causing this or what I can do to further help myself. 

I have also been doing lots of foundation training to help strengthen my lower back which I think is helping.

I also have very tight hips, hip flexors, adductors, quads, and hamstrings. Yoga is slowly releasing this, and I am seeing progress but it is slow. 

Any help is appreciated",Physical therapy consult is in order.,"Lower back pain doing yoga

But recently I noticed that I sweat more nowadays. When I wake up my hair on the back of my head is wet. During the day sometimes I find the front of my neck becomes wet too. 

Is this an age-related thing? Can a non-sweaty person for some reason become a sweaty one? 

My weight hasn't changed in years, neither my diet nor my lifestyle, which would explain it... 

I also had a general blood test last week because I need to extract my molar, and the test results said everything is within the normal range. I don't use any medication nor drugs.","Answer: This could be related to hormonal changes, stress, or an underlying medical condition, but it's also possible that it's a normal variation in your body's thermoregulation.

My brother (28M)  has sickle cell anemia. Today he’s getting a blood exchange to my understanding it’s where all of his blood is taken and replaced with donor blood. I’ve never heard of him getting this before unless it’s just another name for a blood transfusion. 
Are these safe? Will he be okay for a while after this? It’s pretty terrifying going through this. Is there anything that can prevent these going forward?","_Usual disclaimer: no one can provide specific medical advice for a person or condition without an in-person interview and physical examination, and a review of the available medical records and recent and past testing. This comment is for general information purposes only, and not intended to provide medical advice. No physician-patient relationship is implied or established._

As you already know as the brother of someone with sickle cell disease, SSD causes tremendous suffering. Not only are there acute painful crises, but there is often the development of chronic pain, damage to the internal organs, permanent disability, and the side effects of medications (especially of long-term opioid pain medicine use).

A brief primer:

SSD is a conduit where your hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying protein) inside your red blood cells has a mistake in it. This mistake allows the hemoglobin to form chains by linking up. Ordinarily, the millions of hemoglobin proteins do not link up at all. When they do, the chains cause your red blood cells to change shape from roundish to more like a bent stick - a ""sickle"" shape. Because they are not round they can clog up the small blood vessels (capillaries) like a logjam. Lack of blood flow produces pain and other problems.

So when people with SSD have severe recurrent crises, or other specific severe problems, sometimes an exchange transfusion is used. This is exactly what it sounds like: they exchange the patients blood for someone else's blood. They removed the blood that can sickle, and replace it with blood that cannot.

This temporarily.improves the situation, but blood cells eventually die, and the patient's body produces more (sickle) blood.

> Are these safe?

As safe as any blood transfusion. Pretty safe, although there are risks. A large IV catheter is needed, and this can cause problems people who have recurrent transfusions can develop problems.

>  Will he be okay for a while after this? 

Usually, after an exchange transfusion, the patient will be free of painful crises for a few months.


> It’s pretty terrifying going through this.

It is. I am so sorry for your brother and for you.

> Is there anything that can prevent these going forward?

There are medications that can help, but nothing that can entirely prevent SSD. Your brother should have regular appointments and take his prescribed medications.","Are Blood Exchanges safe?

Iron can colour your stool black, don’t worry about that.
The same reaction before taking any iron orally can be an indicator for losing blood via GIT, so maybe ask her about that.

48236,Red swelling that comes from any amount of pressure,"Chief Complaint: Skin swelling and redness after almost any amount of pressure is applied to an area.

Background: So, for several years now, my skin has swollen with almost any amount of applied pressure to the area. This happens in my arms, legs, chest, butt -- you name it. If I grip my arm for 90 seconds, for instance, the area will swell in the shape of a hand print, become red, and burn for upwards of 15 minutes after. (See picture below for example of this that I just did.) This is honestly a bit of an insane issue. I can lean on something at work for a few minutes, and my arm will swell significantly enough for people to notice. If I sit in a wooden chair, my hamstrings will swell from the pressure of the edge of the chair. I have no clue what this could be. All questions and ideas are welcome. Additional info below.

9803,Woke up unable to breathe/choking,"27F, occipital neuralgia, herniated disc at T7, migraines caused by ON, OCD, overweight. No known oral allergies, hadn’t eaten any strange food yesterday.

Meds: too many to recall at the moment, including gabapentin (300/3x), baclofen, zonisamide, OTC vitamins (at neurologist’s rec for migraines), birth control, trintellix. I’ve been on all these meds for at least 6 months.

I had been sleeping for about an hour last night when I jolted awake, gagging and unable to breathe. It felt like I had swallowed a bee and it was stuck in my throat. Part of my throat and maybe the back of my tongue started to feel numb and swollen. I honestly thought I was going to die because I was choking on the “bee” and struggling to breathe. After a few minutes of gagging/coughing I was able to breathe better but my throat still felt numb and swollen (but when I looked at it with a flashlight it didn’t seem swollen really?). For context, my neck muscles have been extra tight the past few days, and I’m having an impossible time finding a comfortable pillow for me, between the ON and spasmy neck, so idk if that’s related. I’m pretty freaked out because waking up and not being able to breathe is scary.

Edit to add: looking for ideas of what this might be so I can research/figure out how scared I should be to sleep tonight/if I need urgent care, and also wondering if I should follow up with my neurologist first (who is my primary doc for the ON/migraines/muscle spasms), and how urgently I need to do that/if I need to see a different doc. My neurologist is a four hour drive away but can do video calls, so would also help to know if telehealth is sufficient or if I need to drive out of state to see him.

Long-term anorexia nervosa (20+ years). Severe bulimia (no longer the case, 15+ years of history). CRPS, hypovolaemia, severe anaemia (ferritin 7)... yeah, I'm a mess.
Medication: Omeprazole, bunch of psychotropic drugs (quetiapine, nitrazepam, diazepam)

Hi,

Unusual question- and to clarify off the bat, I am not drinking apple cider vinegar for whatever false weight loss claims are floating around. I am aware of lowered blood glucose being the only verified effect. Not doing it for that, either. I literally love the taste.

I have been consuming approx 1 teaspoon UNDILUTED apple cider vinegar daily  for some weeks. I have read that drinking it undiluted can pull water from the body into the bowel, leading to loose stool. 

This has particular connotations for me. I will not go into my renal profile in any more detail than an as yet undiagnosed condition of salt wastage (likely tubular damage from years of bulimia). I am losing excess salt (for which I must consume up to 25g salt per day to maintain sodium levels). Therefore, any kind of water loss places me in a risky position.

*My question: Is drinking undiluted apple cider vinegar bad (from an acidity viewpoint). Most importantly, is it causing loose stool?*

Please advise solely on this question. No nutrition or weight-related advice needed. Have stopped consumption in the last few days
to monitor changes.

My partner [30M] [6'0, 350lb, no medications, no smoking, no chronic health problems] has been having these episodes where he feels like he's dying, he says his chest hurts and he feels like he is going to pass out. 

This happened a couple years ago and we took him to the hospital. The hospital did all sorts of checks on him and everything seemed normal. So we just thought it must have been an anxiety attack.

But it has been happening more and more, and getting worse. Last night he was yelling for help and stumbled down stairs as fast as he could telling me to call 911, so I told him to sit down and drink water and I went to call 911, as soon as I started calling he said nevermind it was starting to get better. So I didn't call. 

We sat on the couch and I tried to calm him down best I could, but what has me worried is I checked his pulse, and what I felt really scared me. It was very fluttery, and fast but irregular, not a constant pattern. He eventually said he was feeling better after taking some asprin and drinking lots of water. But I'm scared it's gonna happen again and I won't be there. 

He is pretty overweight, and since quarantine hasn't exercised much, and heart deformity runs in his family.

Usually, if they don't find anything life threatening, they will either keep overnight for observation or will send home to follow up with primary care. If the pain and attacks go away and he says he feels like he is dying, I would lean towards panic attacks, but this needs to be addressed by a doctor to make sure there is no heart or other organ involvement. You need to make sure it is not a physical issue before jumping to psych. Granted, anxiety and panic attacks can make you feel like you are dying, have a tight chest, and other physical signs; but other causes need to be ruled out first.

**MRI reviewed - small subacute infarct in the right centrum semiovale. A few scattered foci of increased T2/FLAIR signal in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, out of proportion for the patient's provided age.**

47591,28 Year Old Healthy Male Considering TRT.. Looking For Some Advice!,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I recently stumbled across TRT via a friend's dad who was talking about his personal experience with it and why he began taking it. Due to some of the symptoms he had mentioned that hit home to me personally, I did a bit of research. Still in the early stages of said research and I was hoping to find some folks here on reddit who may be able to offer some advice.

&#x200B;

Some background information on me that may or may/not be important. I'm a healthy 28 year old male, I exercise 4x a week and while I don't do cardio often, I seem to be in a good place there (I could go out and run 5-7 miles no problem). Family history shows no real underlying issues,  no cancer (knock on wood), no heart issues, etc.

&#x200B;

Some of the symptoms I've been experiencing over the past few years..

 \- Lower sex drive: I used to have a very high sex drive in my late teens and early twenties, now it feels like a chore. I have almost zero urges for sex now. No issues around ED, however I definitely don't get those random erections like I used, morning wood, etc.

 \- Muscle mass: A bit tougher to say on this one as there are many factors here, but worth mentioning. I used to workout a lot in my early 20s. I had a difficult time putting on muscle, but eventually worked my way up to about 195 lbs of lean muscle (6'1"" height).. I've lost a significant portion of this muscle while I still workout and eat at maybe 80-90% efficiency as I once had.

 \- Increased body fat: Again, my lifestyle has changed so tough to pin this 100% on low T, but I would say I've definitely gained fat easier than I used to.. Previously I could eat whatever I'd like and would still find it very difficult to gain any fat.

 \- Loss of hair: I'm getting older, I get it, this happens, but worth mentioning? I still have a full head of hair but my hairline has definitely begun receding. 

 \- Increased Fatigue: MAJOR one right here.. I'm incredibly tired all the time and find the need to drink coffee often just to keep moving. I'm a very motivated person but my energy levels feel so low it's difficult to get anything done and/or focus. I'm typically in bed by 8:00 PM and asleep by 9:30 then up at 5:00 or 5:30, I take my sleep serious and don't understand how/why I'm as tired as I am.

\- Emotional changes: Another big one.. Lot of potential variables here of course, but I definitely experience a lot of mood swings, some depression, anxiety, etc. Up until my initial research on TRT, I had no idea this could be a result of low T, but definitely makes sense.

\- Memory Loss: My memory is god-awful and I don't believe that's always been the case.. then again, can't really remember! 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I recently stumbled across TRT via a friend's dad who was talking about his personal experience with it and why he began taking it. Due to some of the symptoms he had mentioned that hit home to me personally, I did a bit of research. Still in the early stages of said research and I was hoping to find some folks here on reddit who may be able to offer some advice.

&#x200B;

Some background information on me that may or may/not be important. I'm a healthy 28 year old male, I exercise 4x a week and while I don't do cardio often, I seem to be in a good place there (I could go out and run 5-7 miles no problem). Family history shows no real underlying issues,  no cancer (knock on wood), no heart issues, etc.

&#x200B;

Some of the symptoms I've been experiencing over the past few years..

 \- Lower sex drive: I used to have a very high sex drive in my late teens and early twenties, now it feels like a chore. I have almost zero urges for sex now. No issues around ED, however I definitely don't get those random erections like I used, morning wood, etc.

 \- Muscle mass: A bit tougher to say on this one as there are many factors here, but worth mentioning. I used to workout a lot in my early 20s. I had a difficult time putting on muscle, but eventually worked my way up to about 195 lbs of lean muscle (6'1"" height).. I've lost a significant portion of this muscle while I still workout and eat at maybe 80-90% efficiency as I once had.

 \- Increased body fat: Again, my lifestyle has changed so tough to pin this 100% on low T, but I would say I've definitely gained fat easier than I used to.. Previously I could eat whatever I'd like and would still find it very difficult to gain any fat.

 \- Loss of hair: I'm getting older, I get it, this happens, but worth mentioning? I still have a full head of hair but my hairline has definitely begun receding. 

 \- Increased Fatigue: MAJOR one right here.. I'm incredibly tired all the time and find the need to drink coffee often just to keep moving. I'm a very motivated person but my energy levels feel so low it's difficult to get anything done and/or focus. I'm typically in bed by 8:00 PM and asleep by 9:30 then up at 5:00 or 5:30, I take my sleep serious and don't understand how/why I'm as tired as I am.

\- Emotional changes: Another big one.. Lot of potential variables here of course, but I definitely experience a lot of mood swings, some depression, anxiety, etc. Up until my initial research on TRT, I had no idea this could be a result of low T, but definitely makes sense.

\- Memory Loss: My memory is god-awful and I don't believe that's always been the case.. then again, can't really remember!

Long post so bare with me. 
It all started on June 2nd. Woke up with really strange chest/neck pain and a headache. Worried me enough to do a video visit with a PCP at the office I go to but not my PCP. Explained symptoms. He thought possibly allergies getting worse, prescribed a Medrol dose pak and albuterol inhaler. Felt better after a few days of the steroid. A week later, same symptoms. Chest pain which was leading to anxiety attack due to me thinking heart attack etc. Went in to see same doctor on the 11th. He ordered lab work/EKG/chest X-ray and gave me more medrol. 

The 12th I get a call from his nurse to head immediately to ER due to elevated CRP level(16) and possible inflammation around my heart—which could be signs of an impending heart attack. They also wanted me to have a rapid COVID test. ER did another EKG and more lab work and covid test. Negative covid. EKG and BP were normal. More anxiety induced and was given Ativan which calmed me down but did not help with the chest pain. They thought possible pneumonia and gave a Zpak and to finish steroid dose given day before. 
Did a F/U appt on the 15th and was given the “you’re okay” talk and to have repeat labs in a week. 

Felt slightly better for about a week or so, just some discomfort. Come to the 22nd and the chest pain returns severely. More so when I’m laying down. Unsure if it is aggravated by eating or if I’m dying and no one is helping. Had an appt on the 23rd with my actual PCP and did the repeat labs before the appt. He was very kind and listened to me. My heart and lungs sounded good. BP was 110/64. Based off of my symptoms he believes it is pleurisy. He prescribed 600mg ibuprofen TID and to give it 24-48 hours to see if it helps with the pain. While I was in with him my labs came in. This time my CRP was 45.5. He didn’t seem too concerned but it freaked me out. If I got sent to ER for a 16 I would think a 45.5 would warrant a cause for concern. It’s now been about 36 hours of the ibuprofen and I’m still having the pain. I work in ophthalmology so I’m required to wear a mask while working. It seemed to exacerbate the chest pain. When I called doctor to let him know this he said to give it 24 more hours. 

I guess my question is, is pleurisy a likely diagnosis or do I have something bigger going on? Wouldn’t that high of a CRP reading indicate an autoimmune disease and the pleurisy is a side effect of that? I’m just very anxious that something bigger is wrong and it’s not being addressed.","You weren't sent to the ED for a CRP of 16 (that would be silly), you were sent because of that AND what may have been pericarditis/pericardial effusion on the CXR.

A CRP of 45 should tell us that some inflammation is defintiely happening somewhere but doesn't tell us where or what.  It doesn't necessarily indicate auto-immune inflammation - it could be infective, it could be simple musculoskeletal injury, or a bunch of other things.

Based on everything you've told us so far, the problem could be as simple as a mild viral LRTI that has resulted in some pleural inflammation.  It often takes time for this to settle down, even after the infection itself has resolved.  Anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen) and paracetamol are appropriate treatments in the meantime.  If your pain starts to worsen rather than improving, you should see a doctor.  Especially so if you have a fever (hot flushes/chills/shaking), become short of breath, dizzy/light-headed, the quality of the pain changes, you become nauseated/vomiting, or start to develop a rash.

It would be really hard to say more without formally examining you.","Reposting in hopes of a response: elevated CRP & sed rate with pleurisy.

199,Can’t have sex because cervix blocks my entire vagina,"18F Australia Caucasian 5'7 and 118 lbs. I’ve been trying to have sex with my boyfriend a few months ago multiple times when I noticed that penetration isn’t possible. I went to my gynaecologist and asked what the hard thing that blocks my vagina is and he said it’s my cervix and my vagina being really short. I asked how to fix it but he said it’s just the way it is and that it’s just my body and it’s nothing that can be fixed but I really want to sleep with my boyfriend. It’s been getting me really depressed. No matter what I do my cervix just doesn’t move. Not even while I’m ovulating where it should be higher inside me but it just stays at the same position. I can touch it without even putting my entire fingertip inside, no matter how aroused I am. My boyfriend can slightly move beside my cervix and penetrate around and next to it since it’s really long and my vagina is pretty deep anyways but that’s very uncomfortable and not very pleasurable and I’m scared it’d be damaging to my body. Is there really nothing I can do against it?","It's not likely damaging unless it hurts (most likely). Even then... Um well let's just say well endowed men are often putting their penis past the cervix and into the space above or below it, called the fornix.

I agree you need a new gyno. I was going to recommend vaginal dilators, not because you have a narrow vagina, but it is possible that giving increased width may help. This being said, without actually examining you it's hard to provide sound advice.

You may just have cervical hypertrophy - meaning your cervix it self is super long. Depending on how long (you could request a vaginal ultrasound to actually measure your cervix and uterus) it is POSSIBLE that a portion of your cervix could be excised. Again, I'm only saying if your cervix is a long as you are making it seem, or if it's just the vagina being short. Also sometimes people will have hypertrophy of just part of their cervix (the top or bottom lip) and have just that part cut off. 

If you actually have a normal length cervix I would not do this however as it would potentially increase the risk of preterm deliveries if you ever want to be pregnant. Alternatively if your cervix is super long you could afford to lose a few centimeters of it.","Can’t have sex because cervix blocks my entire vagina

12736,"Quitting kratom, question about interactions with herbal and psych meds","I really don’t know if anyone can answer this question but I guess it’s worth a shot.

I know there is little research on a lot of these herbals but if anyone can help at all or offer any remedies for adrenal insufficiency I would be really appreciative. 

I am just worried about interactions with my psych meds but I want to get off this stuff for good and get back to my normal self ASAP. 

Thank you ","There's very little good research on kratom. I can't find anything reputable about adrenal effects in a quick search. To guess wildly, if you're taking a chronic a2 adrenergic drug, you may end up with both lower endogenous adrenaline production, at least temporarily, and downregulation your a2 receptors. All speculative but at least makes some kind of sense—but it's not adrenal gland dysfunction, and treating it like that would not be a good idea.

I would be very cautious about throwing loads of supplements into the mix; it's very hard to know what's withdrawal and what's a supplement side effect, and while you could help you could worsen or prolong withdrawal.","Quitting kratom, question about interactions with herbal and psych meds

Gabapentin 400 mg BiD 
Ambien 10mg prn 

Herbal supplements I am planning to use:
Black seed oil 1 teaspoon at night
cBD oil 
“Adrenal fatigue fighter” 
     -proprietary blend containing Asian ginseng, taurine 50mg, 200mg l theanine, ashwaganda (62.5mg with 7% withanolides) ashwaganda leaf extract (62.5mg) 10% withanolides, and holy basil extract (2% ursolic acid) 40mg


I know there is little research on a lot of these herbals but if anyone can help at all or offer any remedies for adrenal insufficiency I would be really appreciative. 

I am just worried about interactions with my psych meds but I want to get off this stuff for good and get back to my normal self ASAP. 

Thank you","Answer: It's generally recommended to consult a healthcare professional before combining herbal supplements with psych meds, but potential interactions to consider include: black seed oil may interact with Zoloft due to its potential serotonin-boosting effects, cBD oil may enhance the sedative effects of Ambien, and the ""Adrenal fatigue fighter"" blend may interact with Zoloft and Gabapentin due to its complex composition and potential effects on the nervous system. Additionally, ashwagandha may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with Zoloft.

I woke up to a rash last Wednesday on the back of my left hand. Soon my hand was covered in hives, especially on my ring and middle finger. Very very itchy! After two days my fingers began to swell, initially on the knuckles and then the entire finger. The bumps on my fingers were uncomfortable to touch. I went to urgent care and they said it was contact dermatitis. A day or so afterwards my ring and middle finger began to have reddish purple spots on the back side. It looked like bruising. My fingers felt almost pins and needlish when I pressed on them. The Emergency Room said it was contact dermatitis but I wanted another opinion so I spoke to a dermatologist over the phone. He thinks it’s pernio. It seemed to be healing and going away but I believe I’m having a flare up again with swelling on only my ring finger this time. It feels like there’s a blister forming (on the inside of my finger). My ring and middle fingertips also have purplish dots on them.

5144,[22F] What to expect in a colonoscopy? And some questions about constipation/thyroids,"Age: 22

Height: 5’4
Weight: 175lbs
Race: white & located in America


Hi, I’m back and finally got my hemorrhoids looked at! But with my hemorrhoids, my doctor and I also addressed the fact that I’ve had inconsistent and very hard bowel movements since I was a baby. I was referred to a GI, and spoke to them virtually via telehealth today. 

The GI doc that I spoke to today has ordered blood work (easy since I don’t need to fast for this, which means I won’t pass out), and a colonoscopy. I may be scheduled for the colonoscopy as early as next week. So I have to ask— what can I expect? 

I’m a bit nervous about being put under, the last time I was put under, I was ~6 years old. I’ve heard horror stories of people being on the toilet for the whole day, some people vomiting from the fluids they give you to flush you out (I’m emetophobic so I’m really hoping that this doesn’t happen). How common are these things?

What can I expect post-colonoscopy? Will i be sore/in pain? Will i be constrained to sitting on a bubble? 

My doctor seems to believe that my chronic constipation may be because of my thyroid, which has never been tested before. How often is this a problem, and wouldn’t I have other symptoms of a thyroid issue? 

Sorry that this post is a bit of a mess— I didn’t have these questions pop up into after the appointment ended and I sat around thinking about all of this. I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t nervous about the colonoscopy and prep.

ETA: I’m now on day 2 of Miralax (per PCP’s and GI’s  suggestion) and have seen no change in my stool, yet.","Worst part of it - for many - is the time before. You need to take some medication to empty your bowel, and you can't eat much the evening / night before. So many feel fatigued. The exam can be uncomfortable. Some get pain. But it can also be easy and painless. Often not necessary with any pain medication or other pills.","[22F] What to expect in a colonoscopy? And some questions about constipation/thyroids

You'll be given a bowel prep to cleanse your colon, which may cause some discomfort, but vomiting is rare. You may feel some cramping or gas during the prep, but this usually subsides after the procedure. After the colonoscopy, you may feel some soreness or discomfort, but this is usually mild and temporary.

1400,Was my Friend assaulted by the Doctor?,"My good friend, a woman in her early 60’s, went to the urologist after being referred by her gastroenterologist.  The urologist ended up being a man about the same age. She is healthy, fit, and in great shape for her age. Also very pretty.

She went in to have a cystoscopy not under anesthesia as an outpatient.   The doctor told her the procedure would not hurt, but it was excruciating (she’s not a wimp).  After finishing the cytoscopy, the doctor then began to perform a vaginal exam, without telling her or warning her.  He also commented “wow you’re really tense” while performing the vaginal exam.  

What she experience deeply upset her, and she has felt very confused and conflicted.  I’m posting this on her behalf because she wanted to know how she might find out if what he did was normal or appropriate.  I thought this sub might know.

Is it normal to need to do a vaginal exam in addition to cytoscopy (right after)? Is it normal to not warn the patient? The crude remark was bad enough, but is there a pattern here?  Or are we just dealing with a doctor with terrible bedside manner?

Any help, feedback, thoughts would be very, very much appreciated.","Depending on the reason for the cystoscopy, vaginal exam is common.

For most people, cystoscopy is a very simple and only mildly uncomfortable procedure. It's unclear why it was so painful for her, but pelvic tension could contribute, for example, if she was clamping down on the scope. It's also possible that her pathology caused it to be painful.

When I do a pelvic exam I am always explain in detail what I'm about to do and what I'm doing as I do it. There should never be surprises.

Saying that she was really tense isn't really anything to be upset about. It was a simple observation. However, he should likely have realized it was because she was uncomfortable and addressed that.

Overall, it sounds like he wasn't very good at explaining what he was doing and why. In no way, though, does this sound to me like an assault.","Was my Friend assaulted by the Doctor?

Issue: My left ear has muffled hearing and a slight ringing noise

Duration: Around May 16, 2020 to Present

Story: I fell asleep on my hand ( I think my knuckle was pressing onto my ear) and when I woke up my ear felt clogged but nothing was inside my ear before I fell asleep. I first used a q-tip but that didn't help so I washed my ear out with water in the shower; the clog feeling went away but it still felt muffled and and then overtime the slight ringing noise started. My mother gave me ear drops which I used  3-4 times throughout the day for 2 days but it did not seem to help. 

If I cover my right ear and snap my finger near my left ear it sounds like I'm covering both my ears. My ear doesn't feel in pain or irritated, I don't have any headaches or feel nauseous/dizzy.   

I don't know if I should go to the doctor's during this current situation or if I should give it more time to naturally secrete any earwax still on my ear drum.","The concern at this point is if you have a condition called sudden sensorineural hearing loss. This is considered one of the few things from an ear standpoint that should be seen sooner than later. The reason being, the treatment for this condition is high dose steroids that ideally are started within 2 weeks of symptom onset. Currently, you're getting pretty close to that point. It requires a hearing test to evaluate (or at least a good examination with something called a tuning fork). Even with steroids, there is a chance the hearing would not come back, but there is some literature saying the chances of it coming back are higher if you take the steroids.

The unfortunate aspect of this is that this muffled hearing also can present similarly to hearing that is muffled because of earwax or Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). If you are able to pop your ears and the hearing returns, ETD is more likely. If the hearing is down and staying down throughout the day (it may slowly improve from day to day, but should be relatively constant) it is more consistent with sensorineural hearing loss.

At this point, I would recommend seeing someone first thing in the morning for evaluation, whether that be your primary care provider or if they are unable to fit you in, an emergency room. There is a chance that this all ends up being earwax, but that may be better than ignoring something that could maybe be treated before becoming permanent.","23M. Muffled hearing and ringing

I had a Copper IUD (Paragard) fitted in July of last year. Since then, my cycle have fluctuated from being 27-36 days long. This time, I am 9 days late for my period (my app calculated the average length as 30 days). It has never been this late before. I check my strings almost every day and they seem to be in place. I took two pregnancy tests two days ago and both were negative. Could I be pregnant anyway? Any input is appreciated!","Answer: It's possible, but highly unlikely, given the negative pregnancy tests and the presence of the IUD strings. However, IUD failure rates are not zero, and a pregnancy cannot be ruled out without a medical examination.

Album with progression and comparison pictures. 

I realize I'm probably being overly paranoid. I hate that I'm worried about a damn bug bite when I've had literally thousands throughout my life with no ill effects. But this is parenthood. *and it's my beautiful girl's EYE*

Got a black fly bite Friday afternoon (saw it and swatted it away but knew it was too late) Cleaned as well as I could with witch hazel and have continued 2-3x/day. Started to swell just a tiny bit on Saturday. Sunday, woke up to Sloth from The Goonies. She's had black fly bites before and this was an unusual reaction for her. 

I called the after hours number for our doctors office and heard what I expected to hear. Swelling is normal and may last several days. Keep it clean, try to do warm/cool cloths on it (ha with a toddler, I don't think so), and go in if a fever spikes or redness worsens and spreads.

I tried to explain that the redness *did* spread in addition to the swelling but it didn't look too bad so I figured we'd just wait and see how the day went.

Swelling went down quite a bit through the day and thankfully isn't back this morning. But the redness *definitely* spread and maybe even darkened through the night. Her left ear helix is red and warm to the touch today too, but that could be unrelated. Her ear canal looks normal to me. We were outside a lot yesterday and got some fresh bites so it could just be a bite I can't see. 

I'm just not sure today and would appreciate a little advice. I still feel silly for being so concerned about a bug bite. I'm leaning towards just trying to get an appt with her pediatrician since she knows I'm not the type of parent to come in for every little bump, bruise, or belly ache. Should we go in ASAP or would we be okay to wait a day if necessary to see her own pediatrician? 

Edit to add: one positive is that she doesn't seem to be bothered by it, not rubbing it or anything","The swelling is normal with such a bug bite, it’s should subside in the coming days. Your concerns are normal, every parent overly worries about their children. If you didn’t then I would be worried.

no history of liver problems 

&#x200B;

So I just got my blood work results back and my AST and ALT came back at a pretty alarming rate (400 AST, 180 ALT). I drink a moderate amount, about 2-3 drinks a day on average. I don’t feel like that would be enough to damage my liver too badly (my parents drink about the same as I do or more, and have been for years yet they’ve never had any liver problems.

I am also very active and go to the gym and run 6 days a week. I drink about a gallon to a gallon and a half of water a day on top of that. I also eat fairly healthy and only occasionally eat junk food.

My doctor scheduled me for an ultrasound next week and also wants to retake my blood work. I’ve been reading around online and those numbers seem like they could mean something pretty serious is going on. I have not experienced any symptoms of liver failure, cirrhosis, or anything else serious like that.

Due to working out regularly, I do consume two scoops of whey protein, creatine, and multivitamins daily. I don’t know if this has anything to do with.

Anyway, I’ve been pretty worried about it, and I was wondering if anyone has any insight as to what these numbers could mean given my situation?

Thank you!","either

I felt calm, I have no particular stress in my life, and I’ve had a panic attack before and I know what they feel like. This didn’t feel like a panic attack but I have some medication to deal with them when they come up, so I took a full Klonopin (I typically only take a half). It didn’t help.

After about eight more hours of this, and after calling my insurance company’s nurse hotline, I drove myself to to ER on their advice. They thought it was a blood clot in my lungs due to my weight and the fact that I recently travelled to the west coast. They did blood work, an EKG, and a CT scan with contrast. They found nothing. Apparently I’m the picture of health. No clots, masses, tumors in my heart or lungs, EKG was normal, oxygen saturation was fine, blood work was the best I’ve seen it in the 10 years I’ve been getting regular blood work done. They meekly suggested it was a panic attack despite my protests and sent me home.

I took a nap when I got home because I hadn’t slept that night. When I woke up, the problem was still going on. I wasn’t panicking before, but I am starting to now. We’re at about 24 hours of this and I don’t know what else to do. If it is a panic attack, why didn’t the klonopin help? If it’s not, why would the ER have missed it? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if more info is needed. 

Edit: formatting","The answer to your title question is: see your PCP.

The slightly longer answer is that if your only issue is an inability to draw in a deep, satisfying breath (or as many of them as you would like, or a sensation of needing to repeatedly manually take deep breaths), this is unlikely to be anything serious (particularly with the normal studies you mention). This sensation is not a common symptom of any lung diseases. It is common in those who over-attend to their own breathing. More common in those who are obese and in those with a history of anxiety, even if anxiety does not seem to be prevalent at the moment. This should get better on its own with time; would follow up with your PCP about it as well.","I (30F) have been having trouble breathing for about 24 hours.

8971,Itches and skin lesions resisting several doctor and dermatologist visits — Please help!,"I am posting this on behalf of my friend (they don’t use Reddit). They are getting pretty desperate for a solution because this has gone on for almost 3 months at this point. This is gonna be long, thanks in advance to anyone reading through. Tl;dr under general characteristics.

Here is their basic information:

Age: 31

Weight: probably around 100lbs (they don’t check b/c of ED history)

Height: 5’2”

Sex: F

Race: white/caucasian

Primary complaint: itches all over body that developed in painful rashes and skin lesions all over body (including groin area; palms of hands and soles of feet seem less affected)

Duration: nearing 3 months at the time of writing this

Existing medical issues: Borderline personality disorder, asthma, allergies (mammals, in particular cats and ferrets; wine; lime tree; Acari; all with asthma symptoms; possible intolerance/allergy to caffeine). Occasional migraines. Had low B12 on blood samples (they’re not vegan, but have struggles with eating enough) at the beginning of this ordeal and has been taking B12 supplements daily since.

Current medication: Seroquel 25mg (for BPD).

Hydroxyzine 10 to 40mg daily at bedtime; Reactine 20mg; prednisone 5mg (started on 6x daily, currently on 4x and supposed to reduce to 2x in a week); ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hours; clobetasol 0.05%; Glaxal Base cream (for current issue; they don’t seem to do much except provide temporary relief).

Short showers with cool water twice daily.

Has an IUD.

Tried but only moderately or not really helpful: sodium bicarbonate baths, wearing loose clothes or staying naked, no shaving whatsoever, keeping nails short.

Drinking/smoking/recreational drug use: habitual smoker (6 or 7 cigarettes/day), rarely drinks, no recreational drug use

Other possibly relevant things: Sexually inactive for at least 2 years. Got HPV in 2013 but was declared clear 3 years later after getting the vaccine. Owns 2 pet birds (doves); their cages were moved out of their room on June 28th. Used to tan on a semi-regular basis but hasn’t for a few years. Their skin hasn’t had any particular reaction to products before. History of ED, sometimes struggles to eat twice a day, but has been able to for the last few months. Lives with two roommates, both unaffected by the issue at hand. Has no A/C in their room directly, but roommates have it so they’ve tried to keep the temp under 27°C when possible.

Tl;dr My friend’s symptoms and timeline fit the scabies diagnosis to a T, except the doctors who examined them couldn’t find burrow tracks, and we are honestly completely puzzled as to how they could have contracted the infection, since they’ve been in lockdown since March with limited contacts with their two roommates, who are both unaffected. One of the roommates has leukaemia and is undergoing chemotherapy, so they’ve been very careful about mutual contact to prevent sharing COVID-19. Last dermatologist seen said it seemed to be an insect-caused problem, but my friend searched high and low throughout their room and moved and examined furniture and clothing looking for any signs or strange insect, and they couldn’t find anything at all. Bed bug traps came up empty. I suggested them to push very strongly for a skin sample to be taken during their next visit. Should they do this, and is there anything else they should push for?

Photos of the skin lesions (warning, there is some nudity in the photos):

Between June 30th and ER visit: 

On July 15th: 

Today: 

Here is a detailed timeline of the symptoms development + consults and treatment attempts:

— Around May 1st, itches around anus area and butt after changing panties. Personal hygiene wasn’t best, had probably not showered in a week when it happened, and hygiene of their birds could have been much better.

— May 14th, itches have now spread to back of thighs and bottom of stomach. The itches keep them from sleeping throughout the night, so they get an in-person consult with a nurse. The nurse doesn’t see anything on the skin. They get a phone appointment with a doctor who prescribes Glaxal Base, Cerave and Benadryl. Laundry detergent changed to fragrance-free Artik Power for sensitive skin and soap for fragrance-free Aveeno.

— May 25th, new phone appointment because the itches have spread further, they now affect pretty much their whole body save for scalp, palms of hands and soles of feet, neck and face. They get prescribed Reactine and a cortisone cream (they don’t remember which one).

— June 9th, still no relief. Pimples start appearing on skin.

— June 11th, new phone consult. They get a blood sample taken and a urine test. This is where they saw the low B12 (we don’t have the full results but can probably procure them if absolutely needed). They also see some sort of allergic reaction from the blood sample, so the doctor advises to keep using antihistamines. They get a script for Aquaphor cream.

— June 15th, in-person consult with the same doc as June 11th. Under bright light, they see some redness all over their body, but it’s too pale to be seen in the daylight. The doc inspects for burrow tracks for scabies but she doesn’t see them. They get a script for B12 supplements.

— June 28th, I helped clean the bird cages and move them to a separate room in case the allergic reaction was to the birds. Doesn’t seem to have changed anything.

— June 30th, pimples are much more numerous than before, at least 30 spread all over their body, but particularly on butt. They get a consult with a dermatologist, who thinks it’s a case of bacterial folliculitis and prescribes doxycin to treat it, as well as clobetasol 0.05%.

— July 13th, a rash has gradually appeared on their thighs. Pharmacist suspects an allergy to the antibiotic and requests stopping it.

— July 15th, rash keeps spreading and is painful. Pimples have become dry and have formed scabs. The rash is very very itchy and painful, so they go to the ER. The ER takes the issue seriously and transfers them to the dermatology clinic of the hospital.

— July 16th, they get a consult at the hospital’s dermatology clinic. Dermatologist says that since lesions have formed on places where there is no hair growing, it is probably not folliculitis, but an insect-borne problem. He says a skin biopsy is not advisable because the skin is too inflamed so they won’t be able to see or deduce anything from it.

— July 19th-20th, deep cleaning of their room, moving around the furniture and inspecting clothing; they don’t find any bugs or insects, and the bed bug traps they have installed come up empty.

So at this point we’re starting to exhaust most possible avenues, but my friend is still living in hell because they can’t sleep properly and the symptoms don’t show any sign of improvement.

Any idea we could throw at a dermatologist to test for or try a different treatment for would be helpful.

I am posting this on behalf of my friend (they don’t use Reddit). They are getting pretty desperate for a solution because this has gone on for almost 3 months at this point. This is gonna be long, thanks in advance to anyone reading through. Tl;dr under general characteristics.

Here is their basic information:

Age: 31

Weight: probably around 100lbs (they don’t check b/c of ED history)

Height: 5’2”

Sex: F

Race: white/caucasian

Primary complaint: itches all over body that developed in painful rashes and skin lesions all over body (including groin area; palms of hands and soles of feet seem less affected)

Duration: nearing 3 months at the time of writing this

Existing medical issues: Borderline personality disorder, asthma, allergies (mammals, in particular cats and ferrets; wine; lime tree; Acari; all with asthma symptoms; possible intolerance/allergy to caffeine). Occasional migraines. Had low B12 on blood samples (they’re not vegan, but have struggles with eating enough) at the beginning of this ordeal and has been taking B12 supplements daily since.

Current medication: Seroquel 25mg (for BPD).

Hydroxyzine 10 to 40mg daily at bedtime; Reactine 20mg; prednisone 5mg (started on 6x daily, currently on 4x and supposed to reduce to 2x in a week); ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hours; clobetasol 0.05%; Glaxal Base cream (for current issue; they don’t seem to do much except provide temporary relief).

Short showers with cool water twice daily.

Has an IUD.

Tried but only moderately or not really helpful: sodium bicarbonate baths, wearing loose clothes or staying naked, no shaving whatsoever, keeping nails short.

Drinking/smoking/recreational drug use: habitual smoker (6 or 7 cigarettes/day), rarely drinks, no recreational drug use

Other possibly relevant things: Sexually inactive for at least 2 years. Got HPV in 2013 but was declared clear 3 years later after getting the vaccine. Owns 2 pet birds (doves); their cages were moved out of their room on June 28th. Used to tan on a semi-regular basis but hasn’t for a few years. Their skin hasn’t had any particular reaction to products before. History of ED, sometimes struggles to eat twice a day, but has been able to for the last few months. Lives with two roommates, both unaffected by the issue at hand. Has no A/C in their room directly, but roommates have it so they’ve tried to keep the temp under 27°C when possible.

Tl;dr My friend’s symptoms and timeline fit the scabies diagnosis to a T, except the doctors who examined them couldn’t find burrow tracks, and we are honestly completely puzzled as to how they could have contracted the infection, since they’ve been in lockdown since March with limited contacts with their two roommates, who are both unaffected. One of the roommates has leukaemia and is undergoing chemotherapy, so they’ve been very careful about mutual contact to prevent sharing COVID-19. Last dermatologist seen said it seemed to be an insect-caused problem, but my friend searched high and low throughout their room and moved and examined furniture and clothing looking for any signs or strange insect, and they couldn’t find anything at all. Bed bug traps came up empty. I suggested them to push very strongly for a skin sample to be taken during their next visit. Should they do this, and is there anything else they should push for?

Between June 30th and ER visit: 

On July 15th: 

Today: 

Here is a detailed timeline of the symptoms development + consults and treatment attempts:

— Around May 1st, itches around anus area and butt after changing panties. Personal hygiene wasn’t best, had probably not showered in a week when it happened, and hygiene of their birds could have been much better.

— May 14th, itches have now spread to back of thighs and bottom of stomach. The itches keep them from sleeping throughout the night, so they get an in-person consult with a nurse. The nurse doesn’t see anything on the skin. They get a phone appointment with a doctor who prescribes Glaxal Base, Cerave and Benadryl. Laundry detergent changed to fragrance-free Artik Power for sensitive skin and soap for fragrance-free Aveeno.

— May 25th, new phone appointment because the itches have spread further, they now affect pretty much their whole body save for scalp, palms of hands and soles of feet, neck and face. They get prescribed Reactine and a cortisone cream (they don’t remember which one).

— June 9th, still no relief. Pimples start appearing on skin.

— June 11th, new phone consult. They get a blood sample taken and a urine test. This is where they saw the low B12 (we don’t have the full results but can probably procure them if absolutely needed). They also see some sort of allergic reaction from the blood sample, so the doctor advises to keep using antihistamines. They get a script for Aquaphor cream.

— June 15th, in-person consult with the same doc as June 11th. Under bright light, they see some redness all over their body, but it’s too pale to be seen in the daylight. The doc inspects for burrow tracks for scabies but she doesn’t see them. They get a script for B12 supplements.

— June 28th, I helped clean the bird cages and move them to a separate room in case the allergic reaction was to the birds. Doesn’t seem to have changed anything.

— June 30th, pimples are much more numerous than before, at least 30 spread all over their body, but particularly on butt. They get a consult with a dermatologist, who thinks it’s a case of bacterial folliculitis and prescribes doxycin to treat it, as well as clobetasol 0.05%.

— July 13th, a rash has gradually appeared on their thighs. Pharmacist suspects an allergy to the antibiotic and requests stopping it.

— July 15th, rash keeps spreading and is painful. Pimples have become dry and have formed scabs. The rash is very very itchy and painful, so they go to the ER. The ER takes the issue seriously and transfers them to the dermatology clinic of the hospital.

I am a heavy smoker of both cigarettes and marijuana, I only drink occasionally, and live a very low stress lifestyle as an artist in a quiet town in the southern United States. 

On my way to run errands earlier this week I noticed I was losing my vision on my right side, being replaced by bright white streaks and occasional colors. I've had migraines before and know this is a key tell that I will have one, though I have not had them often and typically have to have hit my head or had some type of infection before something as severe as auras would take place. Worried, I stopped at a friends house to try to wait out the symptoms, and started to feel a strange sense of disconnection and confusion. I asked my friend multiple times if the words I was saying were making any sense, but couldn't explain my confusion. 

I left there, and on the way home contacted my significant other to inform them of what was going on and continued to have a sense of disconnect to what I was saying and how I was hearing my own words, like I was speaking a different language and it just didn't make sense when I would try to play back what I had said. The pain as well was increasing and focusing on the right side of my head.

When I arrived home the symptoms reached their catalyst, the head pain had increased ten fold, focused in the socket above my right eye. As I tried to explain what happened to my significant other, the confusion came to the point where I was forgetting what words were and what they meant as I was saying them. I became very anxious and felt the need to sleep even though I had just recently woken up. I slept for about a day, with a 1 hour point that I got up for basic human needs. The head pain was so severe I didn't wake up the next day. The confusion and pain had lessened but we're still present for about a day after all this took place. 

Outside of all of this, the only relative symptom I can mention is a consistent buzzing sensation I have in the right side of my brain. This has gone on for several years now but I've never had health insurance that qualified me for an affordable CT scan, so regardless of doctor recommendations to have one done, I've yet to do so. This head buzzing can be painful, but it's usually just a dull tingling sensation that is irritating and anxiety causing more than anything, but can go on for hours, days, weeks, months, and has also disappeared for weeks at a time as well. At the times that I am the most stressed out about the sensation is when it is the most apparent and potentially painful. This was apparent the entire time during the migraine and hasn't stopped even for a minute since it happened. I am very terrified of what this could be, I know I am not the healthiest 25 year old and I haven't taken great care of my body but I would very much like to know how to proceed with what is going on. 

I would include a photo, but it'd probably cost me a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, so I'll have to keep you posted.

Hello, as of this week I had a migraine that has left me reeling with questions and anxieties. I am a 25 year old woman, weighing around 145 lbs, at about 5 foot 9 inches.

When I had an ultrasound done the diagnosis said 'likely Masaoka stage 1 thymic mass'. I haven't spoken to my doctor yet. I just saw the results today. And then doctors office won't be open until tomorrow morning. Thank you to anyone who responds. ,"The Masaoka staging system is used for masses in the thymus. The thymus is an organ important in the production of T-cells, a type of white blood cell. It is quite large in children, but as we age it gets smaller and smaller, and isn't needed anymore to produce T-cells.

The Masaoka-Koga classification system is for classifying masses in the thymus. Stage 1 is known as ""Grossly and microscopically encapsulated. Also called a noninvasive thymoma. That is, it has not spread beyond the thymus."" A thymoma is a tumor in the thymus. The thymus has a capsule around it, and a stage 1 thymoma has not spread beyond that capsule. 

You may need to have surgery to remove the thymus in its entirety. You don't need it in your adult life and if you leave it there, the mass might keep growing, until it goes beyond the capsule and invades other tissues.","What does Masaoka stage 1 thymic mass mean?

38534,Non Diabetic - Bought A Continuous Glucose Monitor Sugar Level Drops Below 3.0 mmol/L (54mg/dL) At Night,"I'm a 31 year old male, I've never been diagnosed with diabetes and when I've done fasting blood tests my blood sugar is between 4.2-5.4 mmol/L (75mg/dL to 97mg/dL). Diabetes does run in my family and I've been eating a lot of high carb + sugary foods the past few months so I decided to purchase one of those continuous glucose monitors, the Freestyle Libre Link. 

After wearing it for a few days I've noticed that my blood sugar level at night seems to drop quite low, under 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) at times. Is this something I should talk to a Doctor about or is it really nothing to worry about? 

Here's a picture of my results from last night: [

At some points my blood sugar levels dip below 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) and when I do a google search it seems that this is dangerous.

If it dropped that low and didn't come back up on its own, I'd be more concerned about overproduction of insulin, and if that's the case you should definitely see a doctor right away. If it came back up on its own without you eating anything, it probably isn't something to be too concerned about. It could just be that the machine calibration is slightly off. However, sometimes, post-prandial or post-meal hypoglycemic episodes can be an early sign of insulin resistance,. Given your family history, I'd say it's worth talking to your doctor about getting a Hemoglobin A1c, which is a better test for signs of pre-diabetes than a one-time fasting glucose. And, if you haven't recently, get your liver and kidney function checked to make sure this is normal. Also, I would ensure you are eating protein, healthy fats, or complex carbohydrates in the evening. This will help keep your blood sugar levels stable.

It's worth noting that continuous glucose monitors really weren't intended to be used for people without diabetes, or even for people with non-insulin-controlled diabetes. So honestly I do not think there's any reason for you to use one. More data about the minute-to-minute functioning of your body is not always better. Unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so, I don't think there's any reason for you to keep using the continuous glucose monitor.","Non Diabetic - Bought A Continuous Glucose Monitor Sugar Level Drops Below 3.0 mmol/L (54mg/dL) At Night

No foul smell or discharge. I have one uncle with diabetes but otherwise no risk factors. I don't have increased thirst and I actually put about 1/2 tsp of table salt per 1L of water to treat the dysautonomia.

&#x200B;

I have both unusually low and high pulses. I take bisoprolol due to the intolerance of my high pulses on standing. I have not officially been diagnosed with POTS, but a cardiologist told me I am ""POTS like.""

I felt my heart pounding harder than usual lying on my back. I checked my blood pressure and it was 120/72, pulse 56. I checked again and just a few minutes later it was 116/58, pulse 49. 

So I decided to use my AliveCor EKG device to see how low it was going.

It's usually a handheld device, but I put it on my chest to take a measurement because the readings are cleaner.

My pulse was low (low 50s and high 40s) even though I felt pounding. Having a low pulse at certain times of the day (as low as 40s when lying down) and then high at other times of the day (sometimes goes to 130s or in bad spells 150s from standing) is normal for me. So the low pulse was not surprising. The cardiologist was never concerned and transferred my care back to my PCP. Anyway, while measuring I felt a really hard ""flip"" feeling, and exactly when I felt it, it looks like there was a skipped beat on the EKG tracing. It's sort of unusual that I happened while measuring.

I'm wondering if anything can be made out from it.

I am mainly talking about the minor things. Like when a cat scratched my arms or a dog scratched my arms with his teeth, or other kinds of minor wounding.

Because you asked, some nutritional deficiencies (including, but not limited to, proteins, amino acids, vitamin C, zinc, etc) can indeed cause slower wound healing.

Description of issue: 
For the last 2 months I’ve been having this weird issue - my left ear would block and unblock all the time when I do any jaw movements - eat, speak, swallow. I can pop the ear very easily with either jaw side-movement or holding my nose and exhaling. But it will block seconds later. When it’s blocked, I can hear my blood flow and not much of outside noises. The ear keeps blocking and unblocking, and that itself is really loud. So effectively I cannot hear anything when this is happening because the noise of blocking/unblocking is just too loud. 
Recently I’ve been feeling the same thing in my other ear too, but it’s much worse in left ear. 

When does it occur: 
When I’m walking, especially if I’m carrying something or walking up the stairs. Also when just standing. 
It gets better when I bend forward or lay down - it’s only an issue in vertical position. 

Background: 
I’ve been suffering from tension headaches, migraines and horrible tension upper back and neck pain for the last 10 years. It can be more or less managed by physio, but because I am hyperflexible and have very low muscle tension, it keeps coming back, as spend a lot of time working on my computer. 

I have mild hearing loss, probably since I was a child. 

I haven’t been active this pregnancy because of horrible nausea and dizziness until 16w. Haven’t gained any weight so far, but my fitness level has gone down drastically. 

My back pain got much better since COVID because I can work from home in a comfortable position. Normally I would take painkillers 3-4 times a week, nowadays I feel like I could use them maybe once a week (I don’t take any though).

What did I try: 
I am seeing physio for back pain and GERD. She tried manipulating with my jaw, but didn’t help much. She says it’s most likely related to my neck tension. 
I tried cleaning my ears, nothing helps. 
If I’m waking a lot it gets much worse, if I’m inactive the whole day I barely even remember about the ear thing. 

Does anyone have an idea what could it be? Is it neurological, drum damage or is it rather pressure related?

What did I try: 
I am seeing physio for back pain and GERD. She tried manipulating with my jaw, but didn’t help much. She says it’s most likely related to my neck tension. 
I tried cleaning my ears, nothing helps. 
If I’m waking a lot it gets much worse, if I’m inactive the whole day I barely even remember about the ear thing. 

Does anyone have an idea what could it be? Is it neurological, drum damage or is it rather pressure related?

I’ve submitted a post before with no response. This mystery growth is concerning to me because it’s been around for several years. 

I first noticed something that looked like a little dark mark under my nail that appeared to be a sliver, just a few millimeters in length and I didn’t feel anything. It started to grow up the shaft of the nail as it grew so I thought it was something that got embedded somehow. When it emerged, it was firmly caked onto the back of my nail. I found it scraped away from the back of it ok, but moving it along I could feel it actually part or stuck in the flesh under the nail and it was a slightly irritated feeling. 

So I used cuticle cutters and yanked it hoping to remove this sliver... instead the most sensitive painful feeling and it began to bleed. It bled slightly under the nail as well. Over months I noticed the dark mark looked to grow more and more down the shaft. In the picture it is about 3/4 down the shaft of my nail and it has gotten to that point consistently. It has never gotten lower. However, it consistently grows and when it gets to a certain length, it’s painful as it moves around detached from the bed of the back of the nail. 

I’m wondering if this is a growth that is fungal that is curable, if it’s potentially a parasitic thing, but regardless, I need answers. 

Here is another picture from February 2020 when I was growing my nails and taking care of them. This is to show how long it grows (or how long I allow it to grow) and at this length it’s painful to move around... scale of 1-10 it’s probably a 2 or 3 so it’s uncomfortable, but to pull out, it’s about 8 or 9. 



Please, can anyone provide some insight? This thing is a nuisance and I would love to get it removed permanently.

41820,Would exercise cause peak flow breathing values to decrease in non-asthmatics?,"When I (28M) was a kid, I had asthma. When I was 12 or so, they did some breathing tests on me where I blew into a tube, and I was told I no longer have asthma. 

But I do have health anxiety! So, I purchased a peak flow meter off Amazon. When I do it in the morning, I get a value of 660 L/min (I’m 6’1 so I think this is normal). This afternoon, I went for a brisk walk for about 15 minutes. After the walk, my peak flow was 630. It is fairly cold out (38 Fahrenheit). 

Is this decline a sign that I have exercise-induced asthma, or does everyone’s peak flow decrease after exercise?

Thanks!","A decrease of peak expiratory flow of 5% is probably not significant.  Having a measure of the forced expiratory volume in 1second divided by the total expiatory volume is more helpful but that would likely require formal spirometry testing like is sounds like you had as a child.

10869,Psych medication question-trintellix,"I’m a 32 yr old white female, 5’5 and ab 140 lbs (working on losing weight-just has a baby.) occasional alcohol.
Last year was diagnosed with severe ocd, ptsd, anxiety, and panic attacks. I’m now dealing with ppd or mdd depending on which doctor you ask. Been about 4 months of the depression, but decades of the others.

My question is about a new medication my psych prescribed yesterday.
I’m currently on 300mg of bupropion xl which works great for my depression, but not so much for the ocd or panic. I’m also on klonopin, just increased from 1mg 2x a day to 1mg 3x a day to combat the intrusive thoughts and panic attacks, but klonopin is losing its effectiveness for me, quickly. 
My doctor explained that while Wellbutrin has the depression under control, it could be making the rest of my issues worse. 
So I’ve been prescribed 5mg of trintellix.

Question 1: how exactly does this work? I haven’t really heard of it and I’ve seen it listed as an atypical antidepressant, an SSRI (as my dr explained it), a SARI, and a SMS-so which is it? 

Question 2: is this safe with the bupropion dosage I’m on and the klonopin dosage? I mean I trust my doctor isn’t trying to kill me but the side effects freak me out. 

Question 3: (vapid and superficial) will this cause weight gain or sexual side effects? I like Wellbutrin bc it causes significant weight loss for a couple of weeks and then helps me manage weight. I don’t want to gain it. 

Question 4: would you feel safe taking this combo? I sometimes worry about my liver and kidneys having to eliminate all this, but I’m non functional without my meds. 

Question 5: will this medication actually help with my ocd and resulting anxiety? The goal is once the trintellix starts working to start weaning down on the klonopin-I used to use it prn, not daily and would like to get to that point. Thanks.","1. How it works isn’t entirely clear, as is the case for a number of antidepressants. It acts through serotonin, but probably not the same way as SSRIs. Our mechanistic understanding of the brain is limited.

2. It’s a safe combination.

3. Trintellix hasn’t shown increased weight gain. You should be good.

4. Again, yes, it’s safe. Your liver and kidneys don’t get overloaded—this is insignificant in comparison to the amount of stuff just in food that has to be metabolized and excreted. These aren’t toxic medications to either organ (or any other organ).

5. As a plan, this makes sense. I don’t have experience with Trintellix for OCD, but it’s effective for anxiety and a better long-term medication than Klonopin. Your psychiatrist’s reasoning and plan seem sound from the limited information about you we get over the internet.","Psych medication question-trintellix

Over the past 10 months I have had 6 rectal surgeries starting with 3 being drainage of a perineal abscess. 4&5 surgery were a partial fistulotomy (can't spell sorry) and 6th surgery was a rectal reconstruction where they took a patch of skin to cover up the distorted gaping hole in my rectum. 
Here I am, 4 months post 6th op, and in 1 day, I feel an abscess popping up again on the same spot. I am very familiar with this feeling, so I am certain that it is an abscess.

What else could this possibly be?? Why does it keep coming back after fistulotomies and reconstruction, and so many antibiotics?? We've exhausted all of the options I know of besides a colostomy bag (which is a last resort for me bc I'm 16 years old)

- 5'9, 185lb, no daily meds
- no tobacco (smoked marijuana about two weeks ago)
- no known medical issues and generally healthy
- extremely sore and swollen throat for 6 days (more below)

TLDR at the end.

First things first, thanks to anyone who takes the time, seriously, I am at a loss. I'm not sure how to go about explaining all this exactly but I'll start with my symptoms. I figure I'll list them here and you can judge later if the clinic handled everything okay. I'll even list them in order of showing up:

- Very sore and swollen throat, came on suddenly all at once. Difficulty swallowing.
- Small but extremely painful cough.
- headache, face pain and body aching
- general fatigue
- fever and chills, sweating
- inner ear pressure
- some sinus pain and sinus drainage

These symptoms lasted for about two days. My girlfriend also got sick with almost the exact same symptoms, but she felt completely better after about 3 days. For me, the sore throat, body aches, sinus pain, slight cough, and inner ear pressure remained; but only the sore, swollen throat stayed as bad as it ever was. This lasted 6 days, at which point I decided to go to the doctor.

The Visit:

So this was at a Fast Pace Urgent Care clinic and the person who looked at me was actually a nurse practitioner. I'm not sure if that matters but either way I definitely feel like I was given half-hearted and very unhelpful service. It does not help that my job provided insurance is terrible and I paid a $100 co-pay for this visit. I'll get into it.

First off the wait was 2 and a half hours. Of course they were probably a bit busy, so I could easily forgive this if my visit was in the least bit sufficient. I did my registration online and the only thing I filled out as far as symptoms was that I don't have Covid exposure but I have some possible Covid symptoms. I don't think I have Covid though, and I am vaccinated. So I sat in my car for a while and when they finally called for me to arrive, they asked me on the phone if my family has a medical history (yes) and if I do (not really). Then I went into the room and the nurse took my vitals. They were okay, and she asked if I had any fever. I said not anymore but a pretty bad one a week ago. 

I also mentioned that I believe I have strep throat. It should be noted that multiple people at my job are also out for the exact same symptoms and at least one (who I talked with 2 days prior to getting sick) is confirmed to have strep throat. I did not tell this to the nurse, since she did not ask, but she did ask if I wanted a strep test. She also said they are negative 98% of the time and that if the Practitioner thinks it's strep, I'll still be treated for strep. I questioned this a bit, but ultimately decided to just not take the test. I don't know if it would've made a difference.

So after I say no to the test she leaves and about an hour later the practitioner came in. She walked in, said hello, and asked if I had a sore throat. I can't remember the beginning of the conversation too well, but she asked almost no questions except if I had a sore throat. I said yes and she checked the back of my throat with the light. She was extremely quick (3 seconds, tops) to say that I did not have strep throat, and that it was just my allergies. All of this happened very fast without asking any questions at all.

So, it's my allergies? She said that the sinus drainage was irritating my throat. Even though my throat was swollen long before I had any sinus pain or drainage. But she of course would not know that, because she did not ask. She offered me Claritin and Flonase. Which, having taken both before, neither work as well as Allegra for me. I know that because I have rather severe allergies multiple times a year living in Kentucky. This is nothing like any of the allergies I've ever felt in my life. Not to mention that it is clearly contagious. Even if it is not strep throat, it seems very clear to me that this is not allergies. I brought up my exposure to strep throat, and she brushed it off immediately.

She then asked if I ""still had pressure behind my eyes."" Which I had not said and I would not call one of my symptoms. I do have inner ear pressure but I never even brought that up (though I would have if anyone had asked my symptoms). No idea why she asked that.

I declined the Claritin and Flonase and she said she would give me an antibiotic if I want it but it'll only make my stomach hurt. I took a prescription for doxycycline because I am allergic to amoxicillin and penicillin (at least that's what I've been told all my life). She then recommended the app goodrx, asked if I needed a work note, and said I was good to go.

That was the visit, and it lasted about 3 minutes.

I also took some fexofenadine yesterday morning just in case. It has done absolutely nothing at all for me so far but it's only been about 21 hours.

TLDR: super swollen and sore throat unlike any I've had in my life has lasted for 6 days. Had a fever, chills, general sick acheyness only the first couple days. Nurse practitioner I waited 3 hours to see told me it was allergies. I have seasonal allergies every year. This feels nothing like that at all and is being passed around at work, even my gf had it (albeit less severe). 

The sore throat persists. Should I go pick up the doxycycline? I'm heavily leaning towards yes.","That sounds like it was a terrible experience. Sorry that you got ripped off $100. If you can, I'd recommend you try to see a doctor at another practice and get examined more throughly. It certainly doesn't sound like allergies (and if she really thought that, it's very bad practice to give you an antibiotic prescription she thought was unnecessary). Additionally, doxycycline isn't a preferred drug to treat Strep, if that's what it is, so I'm not sure how much that will help anyway. Hopefully you can see another practitioner to get sorted out.","Just curious for any knowledgeable opinions as someone who rarely goes to the doctor and recently had a seemingly very bad experience.

i went to the er the other night, and they told me i have a start of a uti even though i was in excruciating pain and couldn’t keep any fluids down. they ran my blood and urine tests, which they said were fine, but my copies show that  elevated white bc’s, 94% neutrophils (standard 40%-73%) and 2% lymphocytes (standard 21%-52%) in my blood, and that my urine had 100 protein and 40 ketone. it’s also tested positive for bacteria and mucus. after seeing these results and no improvement in my symptoms, i went back. The numbers in my blood were very slightly better, but this time my urine showed traces of protein, >160 ketone, and small amounts of blood. 

they said because i tested positive for cannabis, that i likely have cannabis hyperemis, which i don’t think is the case. they also told me to not take the antibiotic since my urine shows that i don’t have a uti? 

i don’t really understand what’s going on. all i know is i feel like i’m fading away from no water and no sleep, and my kidneys feel like they’re on fire.

I took an extra dose of HC at 6pm just in case this was cortisol related but it didn’t seem to make a difference. I take my other doses at 7am, 11am, and 2pm if it’s relevant.

I have a problem of intestines bloating and cramps, mostly on right side.
As more i am eating, dull ache feeling is like raising from lower right side abdomen, to under the rib abdomen up, feels dull, not any hard pain, but like a cramp pain, or a itchy ache in muscles.

After eating, if I am laying, i can see bowel movement on right down abdomen, on place where little intestine meets big one i guess, yeah, there is something like worm moving after eating if I lay, I don't know if its normal condition, but I noticed it also, makes like a cramp move under skin, and than passes, than again new, and than passes etc. for few minutes.

I visited internist, endoscopist last week, which asked me to do full blood test, ekg heart, and to come to him for ultrasound.

As all test i mentioned were good, doctor asked me how often i have a stool, i said every second day, despite its unusually bigger, and more formed than before.

Than he asked if i noticed blood in stool, i said no as i never did indeed.

Its every second day.

My doctor came to conclusion its some functional problem, as iritable colon, food intolerance etc.

He told me we could do colonoscopy, but we ll just find functional problems.

But, i am still worried, as for life my stool was not really formed like this time. I have feeling its more fat, its gathering much in intestines, and i am still in worry for some malign illness.

Thats why i came here with question, with such stool every second day, good blood, clear ultrasound, do i have still reason to be worry that could be something dangerous?

And, i am 30y old male, 187cm, 68kg.

Can I do MRi scan instead a colonoscopy, can MRi screening find polyps, cancer or any other bigger intestinal/colon problems?

38136,My mother had a seizure after a change in personality. And now she isn't making sense.,"I(16M) noticed a change in my mother (45F) behaviour 12 days before the seizure, it gradually got worse. She had 3 modes zoned out, laughing, and angry. She had been stressed but she usually doesn't react this badly to it. She also had done some sudden and extreme exercise   a couple weeks ago, part of it was in long grass. She says that she thinks it was an attribution to the seizures. 

5 days ago she had 3 grand mal seizure, they kept her in hospital for 2 days. They did a CT, MRI, LP and all were clear, so they discharged her.

After coming back I realised that the more tired she was the less sense she made. Over the last 3 days her mental ability when tired has gotten worse. She is rambling on, overthinking, forgetful and not making sense. Last night she got quite bad, she keeps overthinking her thought process. Talking about intuition and light bulb ideas, and we decided to take her to ED. After waiting there for 8 hours and being checked by ED doctors, as well as having blood taken they discharged her. Without much explanation. They gave us a mental health line to ring, but I suspect it's something medical and not mental, this came on very suddenly. She came back home and struggled to sleep all while getting mentally worse. She told me she is sleeping off and on repeatedly and struggling to get good rest.

She almost seemed like a child again. 

I rung healthline and they said bring her in when you feel up to it. We're intending to go tomorrow morning when we've all had a good rest. 

Any ideas, this is very complex and I'm wearing very thin?

#edit
-She woke up and was very confused, she could barely answer questions so I called an ambulance and we are currently at ED. 

-She is complaining of a severe headache, the nurse gave her paracetamol. Still haven't seen the doctor.

-Still haven't seen the Doc. Seems more with it now, she also has a high BP.

-She has complained of a star in her vision, she hasn't elaborated anymore than that.

-Have talked to Doc and she didn't know what could be causing this definitely. We are now waiting on the medical team to do an assessment and start a plan. 
My mother also said that she was paranoid to the Doc and so they have her an anti anxiety med and now she seems a lot more talkative and is making more sense than before.

-spoken to snr Doc, he suspects either psychiatric disorder or extremely long post-ictal phase is causing the current stuff. I've been awake for 30 hours so I'm going to bed now.

-Spoken to Neurologist. He suspects encephalitis even though everything has come back negative. The antibodies test is still processing and will take weeks. But he isn't going to start her on steroids until it comes back positive or there is a rapid deterioration. He also suspects that she may have had a migraine over the last few days and that contributed to the memory loss, confusion etc. 
The psychiatric team will also see her and if the antibody test for encephalitis is negative this is the route we'll probably go down. 
Also said they may do more EEG tests, potential with sleep deprivation as this is when she is worse.","Where do you live? This sounds very concerning for some type of brain inflammation, but it’s odd given the lack of any findings on the labs or imaging. When you bring her in tomorrow, ask about all causes of encephalitis- including autoimmune. it’s rare and they may have already ruled it out, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. Without the results it is very hard to say what they may have already done. Definitely take her back tomorrow. If she truly never had a history of psychiatric illness it’s very concerning to develop these symptoms with seizures at age 45.

Without much explanation. They gave us a mental health line to ring, but I suspect it's something medical and not mental, this came on very suddenly. She came back home and struggled to sleep all while getting mentally worse. She told me she is sleeping off and on repeatedly and struggling to get good rest.

She almost seemed like a child again. 

I rung healthline and they said bring her in when you feel up to it. We're intending to go tomorrow morning when we've all had a good rest. 

Any ideas, this is very complex and I'm wearing very thin?

#edit
-She woke up and was very confused, she could barely answer questions so I called an ambulance and we are currently at ED. 

-She is complaining of a severe headache, the nurse gave her paracetamol. Still haven't seen the doctor.

-Still haven't seen the Doc. Seems more with it now, she also has a high BP.

-She has complained of a star in her vision, she hasn't elaborated anymore than that.

-Have talked to Doc and she didn't know what could be causing this definitely. We are now waiting on the medical team to do an assessment and start a plan. 
My mother also said that she was paranoid to the Doc and so they have her an anti anxiety med and now she seems a lot more talkative and is making more sense than before.

-spoken to snr Doc, he suspects either psychiatric disorder or extremely long post-ictal phase is causing the current stuff. I've been awake for 30 hours so I'm going to bed now.

-Spoken to Neurologist. He suspects encephalitis even though everything has come back negative. The antibodies test is still processing and will take weeks. But he isn't going to start her on steroids until it comes back positive or there is a rapid deterioration. He also suspects that she may have had a migraine over the last few days and that contributed to the memory loss, confusion etc. 
The psychiatric team will also see her and if the antibody test for encephalitis is negative this is the route we'll probably go down. 
Also said they may do more EEG tests, potential with sleep deprivation as this is when she is worse.","Answer: Encephalitis, possibly caused by a viral or autoimmune reaction, is a strong consideration given the recent seizure, confusion, and high blood pressure, despite initial negative tests.

37659,Stabbing pain post-PE,"I am white, 20F, 5""5, and 133 lbs; I do not drink and I do not smoke. I take 20 mg Xarelto once daily and Albuterol as needed.  

For a little history, back in April, I went out on a jog, got maybe 15 seconds in, and blacked out.  When I got to the ER, they ran a CT and discovered a large saddle PE along with light ""embolic burden"" in my right lung and more heavy in my left.  I was hospitalized and given a constant drip of heparin; the official diagnosis was an acute submassive PE with right ventricular heart strain.  Day 2 of being in the ICU, I had a catheter placed through my neck and into my heart along with 2 catheters through the artery in my groin to  administer tPA and monitor my heart.  Day 3, with the saddle PE successfully destroyed, my catheters were removed, and the following angiogram revealed that my more minor clots were still there, but my docs decided it would be best to treat it with blood thinners.  Day 4, I was taken off heparin and started on 15 mg Xarelto 2x daily.  Day 5, I was discharged; my labs came back to reveal I have a gene mutation called Factor V Leiden, thankfully only the heterozygous expression, and my docs theorized that the mutation along with my long term use of oral contraceptives is what caused my clot to form.

I continued the 15 mg Xarelto 2x daily for 21 days before I switched over to 20 mg once daily.  I've lost a lot of weight; before my hospitalization I was 155 lbs.  I experience a lot of appetite loss and nausea, but my doc told me to just monitor my BMI and if it drops below 19, he will start to worry.

Anyway, now for my primary complaint.  For the time I've been out of the hospital, I felt like I was getting better every day; I even got to run about 2 miles again, which isn't a lot, but was a significant increase from my condition at discharge.  Over the past few days, however, a lot of pain and oxygen distress has returned.  On Wednesday, I did a light jog on the treadmill that resulted in light headedness, blue lips, and a tingling sensation in my hands, feet, and lips.  I talked to a pulmonologist who was filling in for my usual pulmonologist, and she said it was perfectly normal to feel that, given my condition.  I've started to get random, stabbing, sharp pain in my back and chest, along with chest tightness occurring more often.  I was told it's rare to form another clot while on blood thinners, but I'm very afraid and feeling very unwell.  Should I just avoid exercise for a few days?

I check my capillary refill too, and the longest it's taken is about 2 seconds.","If you're having chest pain, shortness of breath and dizziness GO TO THE ER.

10146,How can I secretly get my nephew medical care without his parents knowing? (mental health),"UPDATE: Thank you so much for all your help, guys. So many good points were brought up and your advice helped a lot. I was up all night mulling things over, and in the morning I decided to tell my sister everything, before the kids woke up. She was glad I spoke up. This morning she drove the girls to school, but let her son stay home. When she got back from school dropoffs she took him out for the day. They went for a drive to the park, got lunch, and talked. When they got home, my nephew had a nap on the couch. I didn't ask what was said, but my sister said things were smoothed out a bit, communication-wise, and she is monitoring his mood. He will try the school counsellor again, and from there we will see what needs to be done treatment-wise for his health. She also said that she explained to her son my choice to betray his trust, and he understands. Still, I will talk to my nephew, explain my choice to tell his parents, and apologise in person for spilling his secret. Just to make sure we are ok. Again, thank you everyone for your advice.

15M, 6+foot, ??kg, Caucasian, no current medication (afaik), no drugs or drinking. In New Zealand.

So tonight my nephew (15m) told me (25f) that he is struggling with what sounds like severe depression.

Long story short, he is struggling with the usual symptoms: low self esteem, constant suicidal thoughts, previous self-harm (once), anxiety, inability to focus on schoolwork, inability to fall asleep, inability to get a decent sleep, and on top of all that, frightening memory gaps. He comes home from school and literally has no answer to the question: *""How was school?""* He doesn't know. He doesn't remember.

My nephew is terrified of speaking to his parents about this. **NOTE:** they are incredible, supportive parents, but he hates to talk about this stuff and he is terrified of starting that conversation with them, because he is worried he will be forced out of his 'bottle it up' mentality. I have encouraged him to speak with his parents, but he adamantly refused. He specifically asked me not to tell his parents because he doesn't feel comfortable talking about it with them.

I don't want to betray my nephew's trust, but I know he needs better care and support than I can provide. I am living with the family at the moment, so I can offer at-home support. However, I think he needs to see a professional. These memory gaps are causing him to struggle in school, it's affecting his friendships, and it's affecting his home life. It's affecting his happiness. He is passively suicidal, but that could change at the drop of a hat. I want to know what I can organise for him without his mum and dad finding out and spilling the beans.. Is he able to get therapy? Does he need parental consent to try medications?

I know this isn't the typical 'AskDocs' question, and I apologise. But I would really appreciate any advice you can give me. Thank you in advance.","This is the kind of question about medical systems and access and coverage that is very local. I know nothing about New Zealand and I’m sure most posters here don’t either. You might get less professional but more practical advice in a New Zealand subreddit.

You certainly will have a hard time forcing your nephew into any treatment without his or his parents’ buy-in. With only his, he may be old enough to seek care on his own. The question is payment (I have no idea how healthcare works for you), consent (and age), and logistics like getting to appointments and parents worrying about where he disappears to every Tuesday afternoon.","How can I secretly get my nephew medical care without his parents knowing?

1012,Concerns regarding administration of meningitis C vaccination,"EDIT: after doing some research, I found out this particular vaccine can be stored at room temperature for 9 consecutive months. Crisis avoided :) 

Hey all,

Age: 5 months
Sex: male
Issue: vaccine storage
Vaccine: Neisvac C
Height: 64cm

In short this is the issue we are facing and we can't really get a straight answer from our pediatrician.

We are currently living in Hungary and most of the time it is required to buy vaccines yourself in a pharmacy and store them in the fridge until you visit the doctor to administer them. 

 Neisvac C was the first vaccine we bought for our newborn and no one told us to store it in the fridge. This seemingly apparent information completely went past us and we didn't gave it any thoughts. 

Our baby received his Neisvac C (meningitis C vaccination) a few months ago and since yesterday we realized we kept it out of the fridge for 3 weeks before it was given to our baby.

He is due for a repeater shot but we are wondering if the first shot was effective at all and if our loved one needs another shot for meningitis C. 

On the box it says store below 25°C, which we did, but all the other vaccines we got we stored in the fridge.

Our pediatrician doesn't really seem to know an answer, maybe you guys do.

Hope anyone can clarify this with us or give us any information on how any of this works. 

Thanks!

5396,"Trying to boost Ferritin, but now high iron?","Hey Reddit!

I’ve been struggling with iron for a while - after years of a vegetarian diet (plus stress), I’ve struggled with thinning hair. I’ve been trying to boost my Ferritin (stored iron), especially since I’m planning to get pregnant soon and want to be in top shape. 

Historically, my Iron levels have fluctuated between 111 to 139 ug/dL, all within normal range, but my Ferritin has been between 18.3 and 77 ug/L, normal but not optimal for hair growth. The 77 was a brief fluke, it’s most often been about 30.) Point is, my iron has been in a safe level most of the time.

Recently though I started taking Slow Fe 45mg every day, with some kind of Vitamin C juice. I also was put on Synthroid 25mg for the past 1.5 months since my TSH is too high for pregnancy. I think that probably boosted my metabolism of supplements too? So in the past 2 months, Ferritin increased from 30 to 60, and in the past 3 months, Iron increased from 132 to 192, which is now too high.

So, I’m going to only take the Slow Fe now 1/week since I still am a menstruating woman but I don’t want my iron to stay too high. 

My question though is how concerning is this 192 reading? At that level, would I have caused damage to my liver? Or is it doubtful since it probably wasn’t that level until maybe the last few weeks if it had to climb 60 points in 3 months? (My doctor’s nurse had called saying all my tests were normal, so maybe it’s fine? But I kinda don’t think this doctor stays on top of things enough for me already…)

Thanks!",The iron levels don't mean much. You treat based on ferritin.,"Trying to boost Ferritin, but now high iron?

If I pinch the skin in a small area it seems slightly thicker compared to the other one, but only in a small part of the affected area.

I am so incredibly anxious - I've had panic attacks and I keep crying. I'm spending so much time just staring at my boobs in the mirror.

5325,Radiologists Advice 🙏 Mammogram (F/34),"My general information- Age 34 Gender Female Height 5’7” Weight 145lbs No other medical issues No medications

Firstly, thank you for checking my post and I appreciate any help. I would love to hear from someone in the radiology field if possible.

Last week I received my first 3d mammogram at 34. It was to check a slight indent on one of my breasts that I was concerned about.

I already had my concerns with the radiation exposure when setting up the mammogram but I was reassured that it’s completely safe.

So, I showed up for the appointment assuming they’d take a few views on each side then I would be on to the ultrasound (they’d already scheduled me for both because I have dense breasts - probably in the 50-75% dense range and on the higher end)

I was a bit confused when after taking only 1 view of each side they called me back in the room saying they needed 4 additional views of just to my right side)

I asked the tech about radiation and she said it was nothing more than a few weeks of what I’d get naturally. (At the time, I assumed she meant for all of the views together)

Well, I got home and googled the machine they use - 

I am so confused to be honest. I see some sites say “the radiation is less than an X-ray but when I look up an X-ray it’s .02msv) then I see on some sites it claims mammograms that are 3d are .41msv then others say .50, .71, 1 full msv and still even others say 4msv so I am so confused. I do know it’s a ton of calculation involved so I’d be happy to answer questions but I truly want to know more than likely what the radiation dose I received for (1- 3d mammogram on my left breast and 5 on my right)

For the link I also noticed some very high numbers (msv) especially compared to an X-ray. I linked the tables below!

I noticed it said in ‘combo mode’ it’s - TOMO + FFDM •10 second scan time •ACR Dose = 2.65 mGy

The TOMO mode - •Tomo + Generated 2D •4 second scan time •ACR Dose = 1.45 mGy

When the tech had me take the additional views I thought it truly was no big deal the way it was said but now I’m looking and wondering if I actually was exposed to a decent dose with all the views.

I guess my 2 questions are -

How much radiation is a 3d mammogram? Is this per view or a certain amount of images together?

I was calculating based on the tables for the machines information and at 2.65msv per view, I’d had been exposed to 13.25 msv for all images which seems VERY high with 3msv being the normal background amount.

If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. I know nothing of radiology so I would truly appreciate someone helping me understand.","Not a radiologist, but overall, they monitor the amount of radiation given in imaging and it really is negligible.

Lunch

Dinner 
Can of tuna 
Raw broccoli dipped lightly in sour cream

I dont eat after 6pm. I dont eat any grains. All my carbs come from fruit. 

On the weekend I'll eat pasta and bananas and I'll have foods like ice cream. Basically anything I want to eat. I have a tendency to over eat on the weekends. But nothing severe.

The reason I made the change in diet was because it was becoming harder to maintain my weight as I got older and I put on about 10 lbs. I figured removing the carbs would help this situation, however it really hasnt.","To add bulk you can try adding a soluble fiber. You are likely ingesting plenty of insoluble fiber, which is great. Adding soluble fiber may help regulate the consistency of your stool. Start with a small amount and slowly increase: too much too soon can plug you up or cause bloating and cramping. Use something like psyllium husk, available plain in bulk or as a product like metamucil. Start with a half dose for a few days then slowly increase to a full dose daily and go from there.","Looking for an opinion. Please.

7886,Are these signs of ADHD? Do I have ADHD? Took me 4 hours+ to just write this...,"It's not as long as it seems.

I am a 17 year old male, do not take any medication and I think I may have ADHD. Especially, within the past few days I have been researching ADHD due to realising that I just can't focus and learn in class ANYMORE. The lack of focus has gotten so bad this year that when I'm in class I literally get the most random thoughts within three seconds of the teacher talking. I have had bad focus all my life, but it seems to have gotten really bad. For the first time in my life it has REALLY affected my education and grades. I have got 2 Us and 1 E in my A-Levels mocks recently. I achieved mostly A*s in my GCSEs in comparison. I have never failed till now (first time for everything, right?)

**I want to know if the following are signs of ADHD** **or if it's just me:**

\-I fidget a lot. I can't stand still naturaly. Whenever, I stand I sway my body left and right or do a random action with my legs or feet such as kicking the heel of one foot with the other without consciously knowing. I've been told by many people to stand still then I realise.

\-I cannot focus in class (cannot learn verbally) or when doing tasks that require attention (2 years ago I would try and learn as much programming as possible and it wasn't as hard, but now its the hardest thing ever). I seem to get distracted with random thoughts or something I see and when I have nothing to think about its painfully boring and torture as I'm not learning anything. Even when I try to 'force' myself to keep attention, I somehow lose it.  (Day dreaming or random short thoughts)

\-I have difficulty remembering information. Example: I sometimes just forget peoples names during a conversation. It takes me a minute to remember. It could be someone I see have known for years such as a friend.

\-When I'm studying, I'll read my textbook, and I'll see the words, but my brain doesn't process them so I'm just saying words out loud. I have to repeatedly read a line before my brain starts to function normally.

\-Procrastination and lack of productivity. I overestimate my ability to complete tasks in a certain amount of time and seem to postpone things which later blows up in my face. (I should be doing homework right now). Oh and it has literally taken me about 4 hours+ to complete typing this post due to distractions, procrastination and the below:

\-I have difficulty recalling and organising the details for a task such as typing this post. When waiting to get into the bathroom at home I can't seem to wait and be patient so I (without realising) just randomly repeatedly walk back and forth from my room to the room closest to me or around the house and while I do this, I talk to myself in my head and imagine conversations with others (usually conversations I want to have with people such as explaining something I enjoy or something random) or think about something I will do. About 5 minutes before beginning this post, I was doing this about writing this reddit post. I am now struggling to recall any of the information from then which is a reason this post is taking so long to type.

\-Poor time management

\-I have difﬁculty initiating a task or completing tasks such as this post. In every task every 30 seconds I get distracted. Example: I will start watching a random YouTube video (happened during typing this post) or while watching a video I will have another tab open in which I'll be distracted and looking at other videos  or something else without even picking up any information from the one I am currently 'viewing'. The only time I can complete tasks is when I'm under pressure, feeling anxious or right before a deadline.

\-I have difficulty sleeping at night because my mind doesn’t shut up.

\-When something pops into my head I need to look at it or do whatever that thing is. If I am looking for a answer to a question I will not stop looking until I get something that is definitive and satisfactory.

**TL:DR (The long version gives specific details):**

\-Fidgeting, can't stand still unless told or I realise what I am doing.

\-Cannot focus or learn in class, sometimes cannot process words from textbooks, and can't learn verbally.

\-Difficulty remembering information.

\-Procrastination, lack of productivity, bad with time.

\-Difficulty starting or completing a task or multitasking.

There are other stuff, but maybe they are not relevant. This might be important: When I was around 12 years old, my father and mother thought I had ADHD because I would get easily distracted and perform the weirdest movements and would only stop when told or realising. We went to a doctor, but he explained to my father that I most likely do not have it without doing any checkups.

11708,ELI5 My MRI Results,"24 y/o male who started having left sciatic pain after leg day 7 months ago. Initially thought it was typically post workout sores but pains persisted.

The pain has recovered a bit and it’s been manageable with stretches, inversion table use, and ibuprofen. PT helps to teach me the stretches but actual sessions itself don’t seem to improve much (ultrasound, traction, electro therapy).

Just got back my MRI results and my doc basically said there’s not much I can do other than aggressive PT and go to a pain clinic. Please ELI5 my MRI results and if you have any suggestions I’m all ears.

MRI findings:

Partial sacralization of L5. Vertebral body alignment and narrow signal are preserved. There is millimetric retrolisthesis of L4 on L5 and mild disc desiccation at L4-5 disc space. Posterior central disc protrusion with ligamentum flavum and facet hypertrophy results in severe left lateral recess stenosis. The transversing left L5 nerve root is impinged in the lateral recess. Moderate left L4 and mild right L4 neural foraminal narrowing. Remaining visualized levels are unremarkable. Spinal cord terminated at T12 and demonstrates expected signal it it’s lower course. Paraspinal soft tissues within normal limits.

Interpretation:

L4-5 disc protrusion with severe lateral recess narrowing and transversing left L5 neural impingement. Moderate left and mild right L4 neural foraminal narrowing.

I am not doing this for anybody except for myself, if my attitude and beliefs didn't already show you I don't care about the opposite gender, the same gender, the other genders, or any member of the human race then let me tell you that right now.

&#x200B;

I'm currently 6'1 and 165 pounds, I starved myself down 25 pounds so that I could get a less bloated face but it seems like recessed jaws are what's caused this. I have a very weak bone structure.

I have $30,000 of my own money right now thanks to a fun incident regarding Bitcoin. I put that money in apple stocks. I may have to borrow $25,000 or so from my family and pay that back over a few years for this surgery.

I feel like it will solve a problem with my face I obsess over for 5-6 hours a day and that impacts my daily life immensely. The surgeon I want to go with is Michael J Gunson. He is the best surgeon in the world for this procedure and most of the other surgeons, even those who have trained under him, have failed at least a few of their procedures. Gunson has never failed a procedure and is known to be a total perfectionist both in attitude and results.

""Getting plastic surgery makes you look like a doll!""

This doesn't make any sense in the slightest bit. How can slightly changing one of your facial features make you look like a doll?

The procedures that people are usually thinking of are cosmetic procedures which are quite literally not plastic surgery; such as botox, fillers, or soft tissue augmentation. I don't feel like I have to explain this to anybody with half a brain but if you want to dispute that plastic surgery results are worth it if you go with a good surgeon and are smart in what you ask for, please do message me back.

I've even heard the ridiculous view that ""plastic surgery will make you objectively unattractive, that is a fact."" This is again, simply not true.

The reason why I want to have this risky and nonreversable procedure instead of going the normal route and getting silicon implants is because this actually augments the bone of the face itself. It will also give me more maxilla projection which implants cannot do, as I have a recessed maxilla bone.

Those are just my plans. I plan to consult with Gunson and have the surgery done and everything before I turn 19.

21490,Is there any other way to treat hypothyroidism that doesn't involve taking hormones on a daily basis?,"Hello everyone.

&#x200B;

Six months ago, I had a pretty nasty form of Covid, and after I recovered, I noticed that my condition was not the same as before. If I used to enjoy morning jogging regardless of the weather outside, now I have to force myself to go to the park in the morning. I get tired very quickly. I feel depressed and can't influence my mood in any way. I can't concentrate on my work, and I've become very forgetful. During the day, I constantly want to sleep, but when I go to bed, I can't sleep, tossing and turning from side to side half of the night.

&#x200B;

Last week I went to the doctor, and after listening to a description of my symptoms, he said that this is a fairly common occurrence after Covid.

But he directed me to make thyroid hormones analyses, saying that I have clear signs of hypothyroidism and that I may need to consult an endocrinologist. To my question of how it's treated, I was told that if the diagnosis is confirmed, I'll be prescribed hormonal pills that will have to be taken until my hormones are back within normal limits.

&#x200B;

The problem is that I don't want to take thyroxine. All my friends who were prescribed hormone therapy had various side effects like excess weight or increased aggressiveness. I can't afford such side effects since my work is directly related to the good physical shape and the ability to be diplomatic and patient.

&#x200B;

I read about alternatives to the usual treatment protocol. On [ I saw that it's possible to treat hypothyroidism without taking thyroxine or similar drugs. I'm considering finding a functional medicine therapist who could draw up a treatment plan.

15518,Am I anemic?,"Hey all, 
20 year old male from NY here. No current medications. Only underlying health condition is pancolitis, which I have had for about 18-19 days. I’ve been on here asking several questions about that over the past couple of weeks (sorry I’m annoying), but this one is a bit different. 

So I’ve been experiencing migraines now for close to a week. They range from moderate to kind of painful. Probably about a 6-7/10 at the worst. I’m aware that given the pancolitis I’m prone to both dehydration and anemia, so I’ve been drinking a lot of water, taking vitamins, and replenishing my electrolytes. The water tends to ease the headache, but it’s almost like as soon as I finish a bottle the migraine will come back relatively soon after (within 30 minutes to an hour). 

I haven’t been losing a ton of blood with pancolitis, but I do lose a somewhat decent amount (I’m not actively constantly defecating blood, but it is present). 

I’ve also been having what feels like heart palpitations every once in a while, with the occasional one almost feeling like it gets sent up into my head and I can feel a throb immediately after it. I also had a migraine earlier where my vision started pulsating in rhythm with my head throbbing, but it went away quickly. 

Anyway, should I assume that this is dehydration or anemia? I’m not like actively passing out or feeling super fatigued or anything. I also haven’t been working out recently because of my health issues and finals week at school, so I’m sure that doesn’t help. It’s also pretty hot outside (88-90°). 

Does this sound more like anemia?

Thank you for your time!","I presume you mean you have UC. You could be anemic, it wouldn't be surprising. Only a lab check can verify that though. If you don't have a recent hemoglobin check, you should consider getting one.","Am I anemic?

Hey all, 
20 year old male from NY here. No current medications. Only underlying health condition is pancolitis, which I have had for about 18-19 days. I’ve been on here asking several questions about that over the past couple of weeks (sorry I’m annoying), but this one is a bit different. 

So I’ve been experiencing migraines now for close to a week. They range from moderate to kind of painful. Probably about a 6-7/10 at the worst. I’m aware that given the pancolitis I’m prone to both dehydration and anemia, so I’ve been drinking a lot of water, taking vitamins, and replenishing my electrolytes. The water tends to ease the headache, but it’s almost like as soon as I finish a bottle the migraine will come back relatively soon after (within 30 minutes to an hour). 

I haven’t been losing a ton of blood with pancolitis, but I do lose a somewhat decent amount (I’m not actively constantly defecating blood, but it is present). 

I’ve also been having what feels like heart palpitations every once in a while, with the occasional one almost feeling like it gets sent up into my head and I can feel a throb immediately after it. I also had a migraine earlier where my vision started pulsating in rhythm with my head throbbing, but it went away quickly. 

Anyway, should I assume that this is dehydration or anemia? I’m not like actively passing out or feeling super fatigued or anything. I also haven’t been working out recently because of my health issues and finals week at school, so I’m sure that doesn’t help. It’s also pretty hot outside (88-90°). 

Does this sound more like anemia? Obviously there’s some dehydration at play regardless, but I figured I should ask to see if I should inquire about getting my blood levels checked, although I’d rather not wait 5-6 hours in the hospital if I don’t really have to. I’d imagine that if I start feeling worse I probably should go and I might potentially need a transfusion, but I figured some good ole Reddit advice could help me out before I decide on what to do.

49331,How easy is it to displace or further damage nondisplaced foot fractures?,"So just under two weeks ago I fractured my second, third and fourth metatarsals by falling onto a hard floor and landing right on top of my foot. I've been in a boot for a week (was initially misdiagnosed with a sprain before going back to hospital a few days later), but I'm not walking or bearing much weight in it yet as it hurts to do that and have been hopping or using crutches when I need to move anywhere. 

The doctors said that the fractures in my foot were non-displaced and should heal on their own without surgery, but my question is - how easily can a fracture *become* displaced? 

Even though the boot is there for protection, every time I knock or stand on my foot by accident or feel a twinge of pain I worry that I've done even more damage and it isn't going to heal properly. I'm typing this out now in a panic after putting my foot down on a footrest a bit too heavily and sending a jolt of pain through my foot (it's still aching slightly a few minutes later). I'm also scared to sleep without the boot on even though the nurse who fitted it at the hospital said I could, in case I accidentally roll onto my foot or bend it weirdly through the night and make it worse. I'm even worried about doing up the boot too tightly in case I crush the bones or move them out of place. 

Does anyone have any advice on this? I keep resisting the urge to call the hospital to ask for advice or if I can come in for an early check-up, because part of me is worried but the rest of me just feels like I'm being silly. I just don't want to set back my recovery or end up needing surgery. :(

27851,CT Scan for Potential Hernia & Intestinal Issue? (IV vs Ingested Contrast?),"24M 5'11"", No medications, no smoking, no alcohol. I've been dealing with severe digestive issues that have masked what is possibly an umbilical hernia. My gastro has ordered a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis exclusively for my digestive symptoms which means swallowing contrast as opposed to IV. Does anyone here know whether that'll still be effective in diagnosing a potential umbilically hernia or does it need to be IV for hernias? I'd ask my doc but she has no knowledge on muscular hernias, just digestive stuff. I'd like to kill 2 birds with one stone here if possible so I'll see if my doc can request both contrasts in the same scan IF the imaging facility even allows that.

For context: (I've been having pain 1 inch to left of belly button when I work out in any way beyond walking/jogging.. essentially anything that requires prolonged ab muscle contraction) and this pain is in a different place than the pain I get below and to the left of my belly button when digesting various food types.","Hernia can be seen both with and without any form of contrast, iv or ingested, doesn't make a difference.

But, to see a hernia, it often needs to be ""stressed"". When doing CT for hernias, we usually tell patients to increase the abdominal pressure - squeeze your abdomen the same way you'd do when going to the toilet.

Hernias will often pop in and out by themselves, and if it isn't ""popped out"" when they take the CT, it can sometimes be missed.","CT Scan for Potential Hernia & Intestinal Issue? (IV vs Ingested Contrast?)

14240,Is there a limit or a declining benefit for larger numbers of vaccinations?,"FWIW, I'm a 65 Y/O white non-smoker, but the question is about people in general.

Over the years, I've received a bunch of different flu shots, two COVID vaccinations, Shingrix, a tetanus booster and various others for tropical/3rd world diseases.

* Is there a limit to immune system ""memory""?

* How many different things can someone be vaccinated for?

* Do the older vaccinations wear off as new vaccinations are received, or do they fade away by age or something else?

* Can an immune system get ""full"" like computer memory? IE If I get a flu shot does the Hepatitis vaccine from years ago get forgotten or does everything just keep adding on to ""things I have an immunity to""?","Is there a limit to immune system ""memory""?

 - Nope. Your immune system is in contact with 100s to 1000s of things daily (from your skin, your gut, your kids, the air, etc.) and has space to categorize all those on a harmful-harmless scale. Sometimes it gets stuff wrong (see: allergies), sometimes it gets too excited (see: autoimmune), sometimes it forgets what it learned prior. But it can always learn new things, even if it slows down on how well it learns those.

How many different things can someone be vaccinated for?

 - There's no real top limit here. Again, your immune system encounters exponentially more out in the world than it does through vaccines. We decide what to vaccinate for based on what's available, what's common/contagious enough, and prior evidence of when individual protection wears thin. But there are more bacterial cells on/in your body than there are human cells. Your immune system has plenty of space. :)

Do the older vaccinations wear off as new vaccinations are received, or do they fade away by age or something else?

 - Older vaccinations of some subtypes can ""wear off"" or separately become less effective, but this is more a product of the type of vaccine and the disease agent itself, not the immune system filling up. For instance, most people never need MMR again after a 2-shot series (some even have full immunity after 1 shot), same for HiB vaccines and polio. However, we know the tetanus and pertussis components of the Tdap/DTap vaccine do wane over time, lasting 5-10 years each, so we booster that pretty regularly in adults. Other vaccines covered a previous variant of the illness but not the current circulating one (see: flu), so we give a new one to help train the immune system on the new one. What fades and why is complicated and has some to do with what specific parts we are vaccinating for (i.e., for tetanus and pertussis it's actually a toxoid vaccine, where we train the immune system to recognize the bacterial product and not the bacteria itself) as well as other things above my paygrade.

Can an immune system get ""full"" like computer memory? IE If I get a flu shot does the Hepatitis vaccine from years ago get forgotten or does everything just keep adding on to ""things I have an immunity to""?

 - No, the immune system doesn't get full. It can forget things for a variety of reasons, or it can fail to respond to a vaccine in the first place (one the reasons some of the childhood shots are series is that a certain percentage of people have immunity after one shot while a larger group is fully protected after 2). 

These are all kind of variations on a theme, so just to repeat the theme - your immune system encounters an incredible number of pathogens a day, no matter how spotless you keep yourself and your house. Your immune system is far, far more challenged by those than any number of vaccinations we could potentially give you. It literally evolved just for that purpose, in a world where there were even more parasites, bacteria, viruses and the like.","Is there a limit or a declining benefit for larger numbers of vaccinations?

27254,"Is it normal to have to talk to a medical professional about why you want to ""fire"" them?","30F, Canada, 145lbs, Neuro

TDLR: I am just checking to see if it is normal to have to have an in person meeting about why you no longer want to work with a specific medical professional, with said medical professional 

I am an outpatient at a Physical Rehabilitation center and have been for about a year. I was referred for treatment after a TBI.

I worked with this one neuro physiotherapist from about June 2019 to March 2020. I felt as though the patient/provider relationship was decent, although communicated to the psychotherapist I work with several times that the physiotherapist's conduct made me feel nervous. She told me that post concussive syndrome isn't real and that any symptoms remaining after 6 weeks were all functional, and that it is important to deal with the underlying psychological issues that are there. Whenever I would have abnormal results on the NeuroComm machine, she would throw them away instead of adding them to the chart. She had me believing 150% that I had a functional neurological disorder even though I was told by several doctors and psychiatrists that I do not. I trusted that she knew what was right because she spent time with me. 

When COVID hit, she obviously stopped seeing me. But she also only called me once, in April, to see how I was doing. There is an ongoing insurance claim clouding the situation and since every doctor recommends I continue physio, I have been waiting to resume. I do a lot on my own but am at a plateau. It has also been communicated to me again by a neurologist, psychiatrist, and psychologist that I do not have FND.

After being diagnosed with a moderate traumatic brain injury in May by the physiatrist, I began slowly talking with various members of the rehab facility about continuing physio. At the beginning of July I was told I was not on my previous physiotherapist patient list because there is limited spots. I flat out told the psychotherapist that I felt angry at the physiotherapist for misleading me and making me do things that the physiatrist said were unsafe to do, and now I am stuck because they won't even see me as a patient anymore.  Being told to constantly push myself physically was hindering my brain from healing. This is kind of a big deal. So I asked to work with someone else. I need to move forward. And I heard nothing. 

Apparently, the workers had a meeting about me without telling me, and my psychotherapist told the physiotherapist I no longer wanted to work with her and wished to see someone else since it had been almost 6 months since my last session.

So the physiotherapist called me this morning and asked for a meeting about why I ""want to fire her"". She says the meeting needs to be in person. She also said she wants to continue to help me ""regardless of the diagnosis"". I agreed because I was caught off guard.

But now I am feeling very betrayed and violated. I had no idea that telling my psychotherapist that I felt uncomfortable working with someone would result in me having to have a private one on one meeting with the person I am trying to ""fire"". It feels wrong to have to talk to the medical professional who hurt you and impacted your treatment about why you don't want to see them anymore. I feel as though I should have the right to decide who is on my ""team"" but am getting the impression that is not the case at all.

Is this a normal thing to have to do?? 

I feel like my private therapy conversation resulted in me having to confront the person who upset me in a way that I am not comfortable with. But, because of insurance claim, I have to go have the meeting to either continue with the same physio or in order to be matched with someone else (even though I have been told the wait list for the other person who does neuro physio is about 6 months long). I don't have an option to just walk","That was waaaaay unprofessional of the psychotherapist. Like interdisciplinary meetings on a patient is one thing, but it’s totally unethical to tell another practitioner that you don’t like them essentially. It would have been way better of your psychotherapist just to allude to you feeling pressured to progress too quickly, which would have been a helpful discussion for the team to have. Ultimately, you’re probably better off with another physio and psychotherapist. The former was not treating you appropriately, the latter has broken your trust.","Is it normal to have to talk to a medical professional about why you want to ""fire"" them?

8249,Do I have food poisoning?,"I’m a 21 year old female. 5’5” I’m in recovery from an eating disorder so I don’t know my weight to share. I’m Caucasian and I don’t do any drugs and very rarely drink. I take 40 mg of Fluoxetine for depression. I’m in remission from anorexia and bulimia so I don’t think that’s related at all. I have a hiatal hernia and occasional acid reflux.
On Thursday night I had a burger for dinner. My aunt cooked dinner and she doesn’t use a meat thermometer and just cuts them open to judge when they’re ready. Mine was slightly pink. I ate quickly and then watched a movie with my friends over Netflix party. While we were watching my stomach began to feel a bit off, but I didn’t think much of it. 
I went to bed right after the movie was over around 10 and I woke up at 5 AM feeling horrible. It came on so suddenly. I was extremely hot and I threw up and was experiencing diarrhea. I looked around but I couldn’t find a thermometer to take my temperature, but I’m pretty sure I had a fever. I was freaking out because my first thought was COVID and I live with my 72 year old aunt in a one level ranch so I wouldn’t really be able to distance myself from her. 
I went back to bed and I woke up this morning with a headache and generally feeling lethargic. I’d meant to call my doctor today but I slept most of the day and I was kind of afraid of what he’d say because I’ve never had anything like this before. 
I’ve continued to throw up and I haven’t eaten anything all day. I drank some water earlier and I couldn’t even keep that down. I also haven’t peed at all today. I checked WebMd symptom checker and nothing was a perfect match but the top results were viral gastroenteritis, influenza, intestinal obstruction, salmonella, giardiasis, noroviruses, and food poisoning. 
I’ve been social distancing so I honestly don’t know how I could have picked up anything. My aunt and I got take out Panera and ice cream on Tuesday, but I think it’s really unlikely I got anything that way. I don’t know the extent of precautions Panera is taking but I know they’re wearing gloves and sanitizing everything. And when I stood in line for ice cream everyone was 6 ft apart and no one was coughing or sneezing or anything. Besides that I haven’t gone out at all. I live in Upstate New York and there haven’t been many cases of COVID where I am. 
Food poisoning to me makes the most sense because I honestly have no idea where I would have picked anything up. But I don’t know. I’m planning on calling my doctor first thing tomorrow if I still don’t feel good or if I get sick again during the night.

48219,Do I pay my medical bill?,"I recently just got out of the hospital, I had to have an urgent gallbladder surgery in order to avoid getting septic shock and going into the ICU and/or death. There was a hole in my gallbladder and stones the size of Kansas inside of me that the GI and surgeon both confirmed had to be at least 1 year old (and also said there's no way that it wasn't there when the original ER doctor looked at me). They tore a hole in me when I started having an episode that I thought was gastritis.

Rewind back to April, I woke up one night with gastritis-like symptoms and it was pretty severe so I went to the ER. I described that antacids weren't working and the pain was quite severe. They CT scanned me and there were ""no significant findings in the gallbladder (LOL guess u didn't see the two giant stones bro), liver, or appendix"" were the doctor's exact findings in the report. Even when they hit me with morphine and surgery grade pain medication, I got no relief. I was given a Pepcid mix as well while I was there which also did nothing. They ignored my complaints and discharged me.

I went home and basically doped up on promethazine (Phenergan) until I passed out and just slept through the pain and took several days to recover.

I thought maybe the diagnosis was correct, since it passed. Gastritis and pneumonia was the diagnosis. (even the GI doctor here that helped save my life was like LOL what? and after the surgery was like don't worry, no more ""Gastritis"" episodes buddy, and did his fingers with quotations while he smiled, insinuating it was definitely misdiagnosis)

However, it was completely wrong and it almost cost me my life because of it. I almost stayed home for this 3rd episode if not for the weird pain in the lower right side (which I guess was the hole being torn open) and I decided better safe than sorry.

Now, I just got the medical bill for the original ER Physician that misdiagnosed me, (my insurance covered the hospital bill itself and I'm making payments on what they don't cover) so... after receiving this kind of bad medical care from the doctor, should I pay him? Or should I call and fight the payments and ask for them to be dropped? I have all of the medical records and even pictures from the surgery of the giant freaking stones that came out of me and the hole in my gallbladder.

5931,Second opinion on neglected Bennett fracture,"Age: 20, sex: male, height: 170cm / 5'7"", weight: 60kg, race: caucasian.   

In mid October 2017 I fell on my left hand during a sprint. My thumb was painful but I could move it normally, though restricted.  
It was first looked at 3 weeks later by chance and an x-ray was scheduled. 

In late November I had it x-rayed and an atypical Bennett fracture was located in my dominant hand (left-handed).  
The fracture was a nonunion at this point in time, may still be. About 1mm of dislocation was observed, due to the space between the two pieces of bone.     

The physicians call it an atypical bennett fracture, as only a small portion of the articular surface is affected. Furthermore, it was called a fairly uncomplicated bennett fracture, as the dislocation is so subtle.    

I do not have a copy of the x-ray images, due to Danish Healthcare regulations. However, I have an outline of what the fracture looks like, I hope this is sufficient. It should be noted that the fracture cannot be seen on the hand except for some swelling. [Outlined fracture](

The hand specialist of my local hospital told me it was too late to perform surgery, but it would have been performed, had it been diagnosed early. 

In late December I received the same answer from another orthopedic surgeon.  It was also mentioned that I may not have any complications if surgery is not performed. 

Since then nothing has been done. Information of current condition: 

Not a lot of pain, still getting better. Almost full mobility of motion in the joint. Metacarpal can move about 1mm during some motions. Sometimes sharp pain, but not often. A sense of soreness is still prevalent. 

I have scheduled a doctor's appointment to have a second opinion on treatment options as I fear development of osteoarthritis in the joint. I enjoy climbing, which should be noted.

Ibuprofen, caffeine, heating pad, and liquid heat to treat pain. Only when needed. 

I’m familiar with decoding the color of my urine, but I was wondering if the color can be false? The last few days I’ve noticed that my urine is pale yellow, which should indicate that I’m hydrated, however, it isn’t reflecting how much water I’ve drank. I haven’t been thirsty and I’m still urinating regularly. I also haven’t been eating much that has water in it in order to replace water. So, is it possible that your urine color is wrong?

Hi everyone. I have fibromyalgia, scoliosis, and carpal tunnel, and I’ve been struggling with immense pain in my whole body for 6 years now and it’s only been getting worse. I can barely leave my house with some days being unable to get out of bed. I’ve tried many different medications (duloxetine, venlafaxine, gabapentin, and olanzapine) and they did nothing for my pain but instead made me more depressed or caused me to have manic episodes. 

I take cbd oil and although it helps, it just isn’t enough and I have to keep taking them throughout the day which makes me very drowsy and unable to focus enough to do basic tasks. I feel I need a strong prescribed medication because I simply can’t see myself living like this for much longer.

I am in constant pain and can’t stand for longer than 10 minutes at a time before having to sit down or lay down. Everything just hurts all the time. I barely leave my house and it gets really messy and dirty because I don’t have the energy to clean or do the dishes. I’m currently unemployed and receiving unemployment benefits as I had to leave my job due to the covid-19 pandemic. I am terrified of the idea that I might never be able to hold a job down due to my pain and the increased depression and anxiety from having fibromyalgia. I could apply to get disability pay from the government after my UI benefits end but the amount of money won’t be enough to support both me and my family (both my parents also lost their jobs). So I need to get better for that reason too.

I’ve also tried physical therapy, compression socks and arm sleeves, and massages. They’ve helped a bit but only for a very short period of time. I feel like whenever I speak to doctors about what I go through because of this disorder, I am either gaslighted or not taken as seriously as I should be due to me being only 20 years old and looking like a healthy young adult on the outside. I honestly don’t know how I’m still alive when I’m in so much pain 24/7 and just feel so useless.

I recently got prescribed oxycodone by my oral surgeon after having my wisdom teeth removed and it’s genuinely been helping with my fibromyalgia. I would like to get it prescribed permanently by a doctor but I don’t want to come off like an addict. I am certain I would not abuse it as taking one pill is enough for me and it makes me feel calmer and relaxes my nerves but doesn’t give me that overly euphoric feeling people talk about. I also just know how to control myself with medications.

Last Wednesday I had a chest pain come along to accompany a week long cough. Went to the doctor, x-ray showed pleurisy, so I got antibiotics (levofloxacin) for walking pneumonia. Thar particular AB gave me some reaction issues, so I stopped after 2 doses and my doc out me on Amoxicillin. 

I completely lost my appetite, going from eating 3000 cals a day down to like 300-600, and have been cooped up inside.

...And I've been sleepless ever since. I've tried diphenhydramine, doxylamine, and melatonin on different nights. I'm abstaining from caffeine, drinking plenty of water, and have done plenty of chamomile tea and water milk. I've relaxed my brain as much as I possibly can and have been doing everything in my power to not get in my own head and worry. I have songs constantly looping in my head that started with all this too, nothing particular, just whatever I thought of last. These are slightly invasive, but I think I'm ignoring them and temporarily getting rid of them with pre-bed exercises as much as one possibly could.

This morning, my sickness symptoms are gone completely, no chest pain and no coughing. So that's at least good.

So 5 days without sleep, I'm beyond exhausted but not hallucinating. I guess because I do enough non-sleep resting at night.

Hey you all! I'm very worried and I don't know what is causing this anymore. Thinking the worst, Heart failure, heart disease, Angina (clogged arteries) or some kind of Cardiomyopathy. I've tried so many things but nothing helps. The pain I'm feeling can present itself in various ways. The first one is like a pinching muscle. It's right under my left breast and it feels like someone is pinching my muscle. The other one is to the left of the sternum, which is just pain, pressure like. The 3rd one is towards my upper left chest and close to the shoulder, feels like a pressure. Then there is the arm pain that also feels like a pressure but it does not hurt. Can someone here relate to this story or can indeed tell me that I am FINE? Thanks in advanced and please have a read and give your thoughts on this.

**I did 1 major blood work, including cholesterol which were all within the normal range! I also like to mention that I have been asking for echos/x-rays and a stress test but all of the docs told me it was not needed.**

**2019-02-26:** First case of my chest pain. Started off on the left side and kept going for 2 weeks.

**2019-03-11:** I had now felt the chest pain for 2 weeks. I went to my Urgent care and the doc listened to my heart and lungs, took blood work and did an ECG. The results came back a few days later and the ECG was normal, sound was normal and heart blood work was normal. All that was worrying was my low b12 and folate which he gave me medicines for and that fixed that problem. Told me it was muscular related.

The months between the next visit had it ups and down, chest pain sometimes and sometimes not, always on the left side.

**2019-05-24:** My next visit to a different doctor. I came for the same thing. Left sided chest pain, now with left sided arm pain/shoulder pain aswell. He took me in, Started listening to my heart, took my oxygen level (was at 98%) and later took an ECG. It all came back normal. Told me it was tietze syndrome.

**2019-06-11:** The pain has gotten worse, this time i knew for a fact it was heart related (ye right). Went to ANOTHER doctor, the same old thing happened, Stethoscope, Oxygen level, Palpating and ECG was done. All normal. Was told it was muscular.

**2019-09-30:** Latest visit and this time is was must had been my heart (i hoped). Left sided chest pain, arm pain, shoulder pain you name it. You know the drill, ECG, Stethoscope, Oxygen level And Palpation began. Tests came back, Normal. Told it was muscular once again.

**Today:** Still having left sided chest pains, its driving me crazy and I don't know what it is, trying to be rational but it does not seem to work. I also noticed a pain in my upper back/lower neck but when i get that i do not get chest pains. However, it does hurt and is annoying.

**Total tests: 4 ECG's, 4 Listenings using a stethoscope, 1 Major blood work, 3 Oxygen levels done, All tests were normal.**

Thank you all for reading, can anyone tell me what's going on? Is it really muscular or can it indeed be a heart problem?

At the time of illness I was:
Canadian 
27 yr old
Female 
160 lbs
5 ft 5 in
Non-smoker
No alcohol or drug consumption 
Not on any medication 
No previous medical issues
Moderately active
Pretty good diet
2 clean cats in the house
1 child in school

I’m still super confused about something that happened to me 2 years ago. 
In October 2019 I got really sick with something I don’t understand to this day. I had a horrendous cough, extreme fatigue, was coughing up really thick mucus that made me feel like I was suffocating/drowning sometimes, and here’s the big one…COMPLETE loss of taste and smell. 
I’ve been sick many times, usually get colds, flus or bronchitis through fall/winter and I’ve never lost taste and smell completely.

Hi all,

At the time of illness I was:
Canadian 
27 yr old
Female 
160 lbs
5 ft 5 in
Non-smoker
No alcohol or drug consumption 
Not on any medication 
No previous medical issues
Moderately active
Pretty good diet
2 clean cats in the house
1 child in school

I’m still super confused about something that happened to me 2 years ago. 
In October 2019 I got really sick with something I don’t understand to this day. I had a horrendous cough, extreme fatigue, was coughing up really thick mucus that made me feel like I was suffocating/drowning sometimes, and here’s the big one…COMPLETE loss of taste and smell. 
I’ve been sick many times, usually get colds, flus or bronchitis through fall/winter and I’ve never lost taste and smell completely. Obviously with stuffed sinuses you can have reduced taste and smell but this was total - and i lost it for more than a month. I had a lingering cough and fatigue for months after and while I was sick, tests for strep and pneumonia came back negative.

2799,Does this sound like ALS? Very concerned...,"Hi there,

I am 19 years old. In August 2017 I fractured my back at T-7 level. It was a hairline fracture. Alongside it was fluid buildup called a syrinx. About a month or two after the incident, the fractured healed but the fluid remained. It wasn’t sure if I had always had that syrinx, or if it was a result of the accident.

Nonetheless, I started to develop body wide tremors. They felt like deep internal vibrations. They occurred upon movement. For example, lifting my leg up slowly would cause my thigh and back to shake, lifting my arm up would cause my shoulder to shake. My wrist shakes when I move my hand sometimes, and when I look up and down, the back of my head shakes.

I feel body wide weakness all over. I feel a heaviness across my body, as in I have to think about lifting my leg up, or moving my arm. I can do it, but it feels weak and heavy. I start to feel weak in my arm when I lift a full glass of water, or hold my phone up.

Could the weakness if ALS, start out as being able to lift your arm up, and move around, but then one day you just physically are unable to? Or does it come off as being unable to move the body part from the start?

I also have body wide twitching that occurs at random, both at rest and motion. It last for a few hours. I had it in my thigh last week and my arm this week. I also feel like food doesn’t go down all the way sometimes, like it gets stuck when I swallow.

I’ve had MRIs of my brain and entire spine and the only thing that they showed was the syrinx fluid. I’ve been to two neurologists within the last year. The most recent doctor did a physical exam on me, tested my strength by pushing, and basically told me he didn’t see anything neurologically wrong. However, I never did have an EMG which the first doctor said I could have if I wanted to.

More recently, last Thursday I started to get a ginormous amount of pressure in my chest on the right side, a shortness of breathe feeling...I read this could be a early synonym of ALS.

In conclusion, I’ve just been really worrying about this for the last year. My stress has been off the charts as of recent...If anybody has any advice on what this could be, or if it in anyway could possibly sound like the early onset of ALS, I would greatly appreciate if you could offer me any advice that you may have.

As the title says, looking to get a second doctor's opinion for an upcoming gyno surgery where the surgeon has significant experience removing fibroids but says the location of the biggest one (lower uterine cervix) may mean that he may need to perform a hysterectomy during myectomy if there's life threatening hemorrhage. 

We're reading that myectomy doesn't seem to be very risky but it makes sense that the fibroid being close to arteries increases risk. We'd like to preserve the uterus and so really want to avoid a hysterectomy. Would the 1st doctor be insulted or (potentially less helpful) with the surgery if he sees that we get a second opinion from another doctor as they share the same record keeping system? 

We want to make sure we're fully comfortable with the path but we haven't had an MRI to determine the proximity of the fibroid to the artery, just an ultrasound and now preparing for a myectomy with the potential for a hysterectomy feels like we need more insights and options while also not pissing off the first doctor as we may go with him with the surgery given his many years of experience.","No. I always encourage my patients to get second opinions.

I'm 31/M. I'm 5'9"" and 150 lb and white. I'm on 20 mg adderrall xr a day and 10 mg of paroxetine for ADHD and depression.

I'm a nonfunctioning adult. I'm not on disability and have been dependent upon my family for my entire life. I've tried working but it isn't something I'm capable of, I've been struggling with the disability process.

I got kicked out of my house yesterday and I don't have anywhere to go. I hadn't taken my anti-depressants in about a week until the day prior, due to trouble accessing my pharmacy. The build-up to me getting kicked out was about a week long, as well, and it was very stressful. I haven't been in a good mental space for a while.

I'm at a friends house and I can stay for now but we don't know how long for. I have my dog (he's a small dog - a corgi, 23 lbs) and his place is no-dogs-allowed, so once someone makes a complaint I'm going to have to leave.

So 11 years ago (I would have been 15 and around the same weight) I started throwing up continuously. Couldn't keep anything down until I had to go to the ER. They took an EKG and immediately had me airlifted from the local hospital to a bigger one where I spent a couple of weeks in the ICU. 

Turned out I had myocarditis from parvovirus. I was having heart failure. They gave me something to regulate my heart rate through the IV but I don't know what it was. Then I spent a couple of days unable to move or talk but with my heart beating like I was running a marathon. Someone told me they would put me on a list for a transplant but I guess that ended up not being necessary.

I know it's weird that after all this time I'm not over it, but I've been struggling with nightmares and dissociation and alcoholism and I think maybe I should try to better understand why I'm like this.

But I look up myocarditis online and it seems much more casual than what I experienced. I find i can't explain my feelings to people because they don't make sense. I mean it's not like I had a big surgery. No blood and guts. It didn't hurt exactly.

Can somebody walk me through how you would treat this so I'll at least know what happened?","It sounds like you need some therapy to deal with the trauma of it all. 

Myocarditis can happen with any viral infection really. Severity can be from mild to severe, and some people can make a complete recovery, others could die or need a transplant or anywhere in between. 

Your alcoholism does need treatment, that's an unhealthy coping mechanism to a very frightening event. And of course the trauma of the event should be dealt with in therapy. 

It can be very traumatizing to have a serious health issue, especially one line that which comes out of nowhere. About eight years ago I had an idiosyncratic drug reaction and was potentially facing transplant or death, all because my liver was exposed to something and decided to try and yeet itself out of existence. 

Like you, I survived without any real lingering issues, and I've had therapy to deal with it, because it caused a lot of upheaval in my life, indirectly. 

Any time we feel out of control like that, it can be terrifying, and it sounds like you haven't been given the proper tools to help you cope with it. Ideally, you would have had therapy during/after. It's hard to be truly confronted with your own mortality, and I would guess it was even harder for you because you were so much younger than I was, and at an age when you really feel immortal, and to have that pulled away from you compounded everything. 

There's all sorts of reactions people can have to events like that, either self improvement or self destruction are common. It's an unconscious desire to at least be in control of what might kill you, or a survivor's type guilt that you didn't die and others in your place have. 

Seek help. It can get better. I am not religious, so I don't believe that things happen for a reason - I think things happen and when big random events like that happen, we don't deserve them, whether it's a good or bad. They are just random chance.

But it never did and it seems to be permanent, should I be concerned? (Sorry if there’s any grammatical errors, English isn’t my first language)

9026,MRI Fun: Guess That Organ!,"Age 28Y, Female

No diagnosis needed here - I'll get the results back in a few days (I'm sure it's all normal anyway), but the report won't include an answer to my curiosity, which is why I am here.

I was having a bit of fun perusing my MRI images from an abdominal study that was completed on Sunday, when I started a spirited game of ""Guess that Organ!""

It was a fun way to pass some time, and learn more about MRI technology- its fascinating stuff!
 
One piece I could not identify, but was curious about, was in the upper abdomen area. Link below includes 3 individual slices, and GIFs of Cor T2, Axial T2, and Axial T2 Fat Supress. My assumption was it is the same organ/anatomical feature in all three, but that might be inaccurate. 

There are white arrows pointing to the area I couldn't figure out. My best guess was Small Intestine w/ Gas. Someone else thought it was my liver.

I have a whole bunch of other including MRCP, Pre/Post Contrast Sequences if that would help solve the mystery, but I'm betting it's a pretty simple answer.

What say you, Ask Docs? 

Again, this is just a light hearted MRI question. It's just fun to look at what medical imaging is capable of seeing.

Location (Geographic and on body) Stomach

Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) No.

Current medications (if any) Omeprazole.

I have had the disease for almost 4 years now. It started with occasional burping and developed badly. I have stomach acids mainly before going to bed most of the time, especially when I am under stress or if I don't take my Omeprazole. After eating almost anything  I'm forced  to burp to get rid of the excess gas in my stomach. During burping I don't get acids from my stomach most of the time, but sometimes little pieces of food come into my mouth from my stomach. Sometimes the burping is just too much, it makes it hard to breathe or do anything. When I am out in the open with people I don't burp, because my body is too ""tense"" to do it.

I have a huge appetite, but I consider it normal because I try to exercise and eat healthy. I don't eat junk food, my only ""cheat meal"" is candy.  I don't drink coffee or alcohol, I don't smoke, I don't like spicy foods. I like to eat meat. My diet consists mostly pork and chicken meat, rice, potatoes and other vegetables. The problem is in my opinion that I tend to eat too often and also when I am hungry I tend to eat too fast, but I can't help it.

I went to two doctors, both didn't find anything wrong in particural with my body, my lab results were perfect, and they told my to drink Omeprazole twice a day an hour before eating.  I was tested for H pylori two years ago. The results were negative. I did not have it.  I took Omeprazole for more than two weeks, while I was taking it I was OK, but the simptoms did not disseapear. But I don't like the idea of taking pills every single day. So when it gets worse, I drink one omeprazole an hour before eating and it helps me if I keep taking it for a week. But when I stop taking the pills my condition gets worse. Will I have to keep taking omeprazole for the rest of my life?

I take rigevidon and have done since age 14
I also take a daily over the counter multivitamin and mineral and a probiotic. I also occasionally take antihistamines for snotty nose and dry eyes Jan - March, think it may be hay-fever but have never been diagnosed with this. 

I have been having tachycardia for a long time, it was looked in to when I was a teenager with an echo and ecg tapes and NAD other than HR up to 225 at rest. No further investigations were done. I did get fainting episodes but these stopped when I was on the pill. 

More recently found to have tachycardia at rest after GP visit and my heart rate on my smart watch has been 30-200. Recent Ecg and echos showed same as prev. Cardio px nebivolol and requested a tilt table which was positive with provocation and BP dropped to 72/19. They have now referred on to a cardiologist and electrophysiologist but waiting list is around 9 months (I'm 1 month in). They have also advised no excercise, although I am still doing normal activities and walking the dogs as able. 

Since this I have been measuring my BP at home and this has been 62/38 to 248/210 all sat down and resting. 

At both ends I am symptomatic:
High BP leads to sweating, mood changes and a feeling I cannot describe
Low BP makes me feel dizzy, cold and like the room is spinning. The last episode lasted for 3 hours.

I have also been having severe abdo pain which wakes me up, this has also been investigated and they determined pain is due to adhesions from my hernia operation. I also wake up drenched in sweat at 2-3am a few times a month. I am constantly thirsty and would happily drink 6+ litres daily but try to limit myself. I will wake up thirsty in the middle of the night. When my blood sugar has been tested it has always been around 2-3 mmol fasted or 6-8 mmol post eating. 

After my last low BP episode my GP did morning cortisol, U+E, thyroid panel, FBC and liver enzymes all of which were reported to be in normal limits.

Height: 5'5
Duration of complaint: 2 days
Location: Missouri
Location on body: face 
Relevant medical condition: none


I have some strange, itchy, BURNING, rash on my face, specifically around my eyes and covering my lips. It started on my lips, went to my left eye, and has now made it to my right eye. It itches terrible bad, and burns constantly, especially on my lips. 

I went to the emergency room last night (I have no insurance, no primary, and no money) and was diagnosed with Shingles, given Zovirax to take 5X a day for 7 days, and sent home. I am a healthy 24 year old and I have never had chicken pox (received the vaccine as a kid). I have no idea where this diagnosis came from. There is nothing on my back or stomach, only my face. 

I'm hoping that one of the low income clinics I'm looking up can fit me in on a Friday, but I'm not holding my breath. Can anyone PLEASE help me figure out what is going on with my face??

33148,"Mother with Munchausen's ""diagnosed"" with multiple sclerosis","My mother is the daughter of two alcoholics. All of her family members worked in hospitals. I suspect she learned growing up that sick people get all the attention.

When I was growing up she had me and my brother diagnosed with everything under the sun. As I grew up, I realized she was doing it partly to get attention and partly to explain away any challenges she felt as a parent. As an adult, I went to multiple doctors on my own to check on ""my conditions"", and they all told me I have no conditions.

When my brother and I left home, she did the same thing to her dogs: constant medical diagnoses and drugs.

Eventually I realized she's doing the same thing to herself. She constantly uses feeling ill as an excuse to get out of anything she doesn't want to do, because you can't argue with that. She once called from a hospital to tell me she was fine, but she sounded eerily happy to be in a hospital.

In the late 90s, she thought she had lupus. Then she said it wasn't lupus, that a doctor had diagnosed her with MS. I remember her using a walker for about a week. Since then, zero symptoms. She takes weekly injections and likes to bring up ""her MS"" in conversation. She talks about it to total strangers like it's a badge of honor.

I've read about how MS is diagnosed, and it seems there's room for a doctor to be fooled by someone who invents and exaggerates symptoms to get diagnoses. But am I right about that?

And would taking injections for MS when you don't actually have MS cause any side effects others would notice?

And finally, is it possible some wise doctor saw through her and prescribed a placebo that's injected and that somehow other doctors have continued to give her for 20 years as she's moved from state to state?

I do realize it's possible she actually has MS (that would be a dream come true for her), but given her history and the fact that she's nearly 70 years old and engages in activities that suggest she is in very good health, I find it hard to believe. Yes, it could just be the drugs are working really well. I'm wondering about likelihoods here from the perspective of medical insiders who know about MS, diagnosis, drugs, and side effects. I've read all I can online and am still unsure.

Maybe I will be till she dies and we look for lesions on her brain...","It's a diagnosis typically based off set of criteria. Brain/Spine imaging to see evidence of new/old lesions combined with presentation and clinical symptoms. But yes it's a diagnosis that lacks any single completely objective test, therapy can include medications with some potentially serious side effects however lack of imaging to support presence of lesions (often quite a few)

Prescribing a placebo is not something most doctors would do. Enters un-ethical territory real quick and is misleading the patient even if one suspects they are not genuine.","Mother with Munchausen's ""diagnosed"" with multiple sclerosis

7356,Pain after removed mole from two months ago,"28F
5’2” 140lbs
No medications
Occasionally drinking, no drugs, don’t smoke
White/Mexican

*i had type a much better version of the post and accidentally closed the app and lost my patience*

On 1/23/2020 I had 3 [moles]( removed. 

2 on neckline: were large and raised, but removed for cosmetic reasons

1 atypical on chest just below neckline: smaller flush to skin, but irregular in shape and was recommended by doctor to remove. They removed much more surrounding skin than the other two. 

The doctor did not cauterize the wounds, since they are in a more cosmetically sensitive area and was trying to limit scarring.

All seemed to heal fine and in a normal amount of time.

They tested all moles and 2 cosmetic moles came back as benign and I was given this information on the atypical mole:

“NOT a cancer, just an atypical mole, but recommend excision to ensure complete removal and check areas missed by biopsy”

I had made an appointment for the excision for late March and due to the current climate, it was obviously postponed until who knows when.

Now, my current complaint is that the one atypical mole has mild pain. Usually caused by whatever shirt I’m wearing, but also sometimes stings on it’s own when I’m just in a sports bra and nothing is touching it. The pain feels like a bunch of teeny splinters are just poking through the surface of the skin and then you rubbed it. Also, the pain has seemed to slowly increase over time.

Although the mole was flush, the area is now raise and pink. It also has tiny spider veins going through it that can barely be made out in the photos.

The other two moles have none of these traits. Plus I’ve had other moles removed in the past and although some stayed raised, they didn’t have this pain or pinkness.

I do not think this pain warrants going to the doctor right now, but I do have some questions that hopefully can be answered here.

If any of these break the rules, please disregard. 

Is there any over the counter ointment or topical cream that might help with the pain? I’m not sure if they would even work, but I haven’t been taking any Tylenol or anything of the sort because I work at a retirement community and having my temperature taking a few times a day to help prevent COVID and I’d hate to be accidentally reducing a fever.

Because the pain increases over time and the appearance of spider veins, could this be due to nerve ends growing back? Will this eventually fade? The other two have zero pain.

Could this be due to clothing rubbing it? I’ve had other moles removed in areas that are constantly covered by clothes and none have reacted like this. I wear a necklace(sterling silver) always, but removed it while they were healing. This is also the only mole I’ve had that was recommended for excision after the biopsy. 

Thanks in advance for any help! Always wear sunscreen kids!",The process of wound healing is a complex and long one. The spot of your concern looks completely normal. The discomfort will likely decrease over time.,"Pain after removed mole from two months ago

It's more that as you get exposed to more stuff, you *will* get more bugs and illnesses and those words can help comfort worried parents.  Most people have a functional immune system, react appropriately to disease.","Illnesses as a baby/toddler helps in creating a strong(er) immune system?

I’m absolutely happy to get the test on both sides of my flight, but not if the test results are unlikely to be accurate. I’m a type 1 diabetic with 8.4 a1c level. My two parents are fit and active mid-60s age.  

Any thoughts?  And thanks!","COVID-19 PCR test are very good, the reason you may hear of false negatives has more to do with the quality of the sample provided to the lab than anything else.

A positive test means you almost definitely have COVID. False positives are extremely rare. A negative test does not mean you definitely don’t have COVID for the reason I stated above, but if you don’t have any symptoms and get a negative test, it’s unlikely you have COVID.

Doctors in our small town just keep shrugging and passing her to another doctor. She has had some of these issues for a long time but recently they have gotten so bad she can't function normally and has had to stop working. I was hoping someone here could share their wisdom.

**Here are her symptoms:**

* cold all the time
* numbness
* always have to pee
* weakness
* weak limbs 
* decreasing strength
* severe migraines (known triggers, strange visuals where half of everyone's body is missing)
* what is thought to be visual snow syndrome while eyes are open and closed
* stomach and lower abdominal pain (mainly after eating)
* lethargic after eating (have to nap)
* persistent headache
* shortness of breath
* loss of balance
* dizzy when standing up (sometimes)
* issues with focusing words on paper/screens
* jolts/shivers/spasms

**Things to note:**

* diagnosis with Hashimoto's at age 17, reversal of diagnosis at age 24
* history of concussions and head trauma in adolescent years
* allergies: shellfish, coffee (causes migraines)
* encouraged to not eat gluten, high caffeine, and soy from Hashimoto's diagnosis. So she avoids it to this day
* worked on fish truck while undiagnosed with shellfish allergy (likely worsened health)
* nutritionist found high cortisol in urine
* 8 day bedridden recovery from vaccine 2nd dose (haven't felt the same since)
* period occurs despite brand new IUD (didn't happen with last one)
* super sensitive to lights

Does this indicate anything to anyone? She has had tons of tests and it does not seem to be something simple like low iron. Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.","OP nicely describes a patient with post-concussion syndrome and hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism causes lethargy, generalized weakness, and cold temperature.

Post-concussion syndrome causes dizziness, loss of balance, focus, word finding, visual comprehension, sensitivity to light and sound, and sensory abnormalities in the body. 

It is often accompanied by headache. In those patients predisposed or with a familial history of migraine, we often see post-concussion headache manifest as migraine. Classic migraine is accompanied by scotoma — described as bright lines that persist on half the visual field — which will lead to seeing only one half of whomever she is looking at.

Migraine can also manifest as abdominal pain, although there may be other causes for stomach pain such as indigestion or gastritis, both of which are fairly common.

This patient should see an endocrinologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of thyroid function and receive treatment.

Hey all, my partner has been struggling so much to discover what is wrong with her. Doctors in our small town just keep shrugging and passing her to another doctor. She has had some of these issues for a long time but recently they have gotten so bad she can't function normally and has had to stop working. I was hoping someone here could share their wisdom.

**Here are her symptoms:**

* cold all the time
* numbness
* always have to pee
* weakness
* weak limbs 
* decreasing strength
* severe migraines (known triggers, strange visuals where half of everyone's body is missing)
* what is thought to be visual snow syndrome while eyes are open and closed
* stomach and lower abdominal pain (mainly after eating)
* lethargic after eating (have to nap)
* persistent headache
* shortness of breath
* loss of balance
* dizzy when standing up (sometimes)
* issues with focusing words on paper/screens
* jolts/shivers/spasms

**Things to note:**

* diagnosis with Hashimoto's at age 17, reversal of diagnosis at age 24
* history of concussions and head trauma in adolescent years
* allergies: shellfish, coffee (causes migraines)
* encouraged to not eat gluten, high caffeine, and soy from Hashimoto's diagnosis. So she avoids it to this day
* worked on fish truck while undiagnosed with shellfish allergy (likely worsened health)
* nutritionist found high cortisol in urine
* 8 day bedridden recovery from vaccine 2nd dose (haven't felt the same since)
* period occurs despite brand new IUD (didn't happen with last one)
* super sensitive to lights

Does this indicate anything to anyone? She has had tons of tests and it does not seem to be something simple like low iron. Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.","Answer: This patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), possibly triggered by the vaccine, shellfish allergy, or other environmental factors, with potential involvement of other conditions such as Small Fiber Neuropathy or Mitochondrial dysfunction.

Hypothyroidism causes lethargy, generalized weakness, and cold temperature. Post-concussion syndrome causes dizziness, loss of balance, focus, word finding, visual comprehension, sensitivity to light and sound, and sensory abnormalities in the body. It is often accompanied by headache. In those patients predisposed or with a familial history of migraine, we often see post-concussion headache manifest as migraine. Classic migraine is accompanied by scotoma — described as bright lines that persist on half the visual field — which will lead to seeing only one half of whomever she is looking at. Migraine can also manifest as abdominal pain, although there may be other causes for stomach pain such as indigestion or gastritis, both of which are fairly common. This patient should see an endocrinologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of thyroid function and receive treatment.

21115,Weird pus below my ear? [image included]," [ 

Hello, I've had this weird pus looking thing under my ear for less than a year. I have had no other big medical issues regarding my skin or anything. I do think that it could be related to my piercing as it came up after I got my first piercing ( 2019 September ), but the ear lobes themselves are completely fine. My other ear looks completely fine as well. There is no pain, but when I press against it, it stings. Also, the texture is kind of mushy when I press against it.

My thought is that I was scratching under my ear unconsciously as it was getting itchy from the recently obtained piercing, and got a scar.

Should I get treated immediately?

43569,Am I having a miscarriage?,"Okay, so I’m (20F) exactly 8 weeks pregnant today! Which is a wonderful thing. This is my second pregnancy, and both me and the father (22M) are very healthy and fit. I’ve been having a lot worse fatigue and nausea this time around, a lot worse than I remember the first time, which I started noticing at the one week mark.

So we start walking, and I find the restroom. I look down at my shorts as I’m getting my mask out of the stroller, and I see a dark spot half the size of a penny on my shorts. I immediately panic and run into the restroom. (Sorry if this is too graphic) so there was a half dollar size spot in my underpants, mostly clear but definitely a tiny bit of blood mixed in, making it a really light brown. (I know it’s blood because it stained my shorts) and it had a very distinct and somewhat strong smell. I wiped myself and there was no brown that came off onto the toilet paper, it was actually barely wet. I haven’t had any cramps the past few days, and I actually felt a bit energized after my morning sickness (more than usual I should say) But I am still panicking.

6425,Odd Scaphoid Diagnosis?,"Hi all,

In early November, I injured my wrist playing hockey. I ultimately bent my wrist downward while crashing into another player and heard a crack. I thought it was likely a sprain and kept playing. That night it predictably swelled up, but didn't hurt too bad, and I iced it. 

Long story short, after a few weeks it hadn't healed up and I went to the doctor. They gave me an X-Ray but weren't concerned and gave me a soft brace, saying it wasn't anything serious. I then went out of the country and when I got back it still was hurting, so I went to another doctor for a second opinion. I got another X-ray done (this was like 3 weeks ago now) and the doctor said she wasn't sure but it was possible there was a scaphoid fracture...when she made the x-ray very dark there was a slight discolored line. Ok, fine. But, she said since the initial injury happened like 10 weeks prior and it appeared to be healing up, a cast wasn't neccessary. She also mentioned it could just be a bone bruise?

I don't know much about this stuff, but it's now been like 14 weeks and I have discomfort when doing push ups and pushing motions, and I just need some more nuanced explanation. Everyone I've seen so far didn't seem particularly concerned, but I know the scaphoid has bad blood supply to start and if it is indeed a fracture (in her official prescription for PT she did not use that word, she just used ""wrist pain"") there can be bad complications. 

It just seems like if there was a possibility of a fracture it would have been put in a cast or a splint or something? I'm very concerned I've been misdiagnosed. I'll be calling another doctor in the morning.

Any insight is appreciated.

**Age: 24**

**Weight: 66kg**

**Height: 5""9**

**Location: UK**

Last year out of nowhere I had a really bad ballache for about 2 months. Doctor inspected my parts, did a few urine tests, an ultrasound and the conclusion was that nothing was wrong with me. Luckily, this went away on it's own.

About 2 months after this (not sure if related), I randomly got erectile dysfunction. I woke up one day without morning wood which I found weird so I watched some porn to make sure everything was OK down there - but my penis just refused to get erect. Then my penis started changing shape (looked like an hourglass at one point), the glans remained flaccid while I was erect, peeing became more difficult, I was ejaculating with less force & volume, and my penis also feels different (more swollen).

This got slightly better over time, though still a problem. The doctor sent me to get a few blood tests, told me nothing was wrong with me (again) and I never went back since.

Now I am realising that my urethra has definitely gotten narrower, particularly at the tip. When I ejaculate now a build-up of semen happens at the tip then it just dribbles down. Near the end of peeing the urine also starts dribbling down. There is no doubt in my mind that I have meatal stenosis/urethral stricture.

At this point I don't even care about the ED or how weird my penis looks - I've accepted that my sex life is over. What's bugging me is this urethra problem seems like something that could get MUCH worse over time and all of the treatments I see online involve shoving a tube inside my penis. That is something I absolutely cannot go through with, just the thought of it gets my heart racing.

So few weeks back I had a kind of weird viral fever where it would rise in afternoon and by night it'd subside. After 3 days I was told to took little paracetamol and to take plenty of rest. In two days the fever symptoms went but I couldn't eat well. I also noticed that my urine steadily turning darker despite me trying to drink enough water (even ORS). When the urine turned orangish in morning I thought something might be funny with my liver. I got my blood tested for liver functions and jaundice was confirmed (by this time my sclera turned yellow).

From then I've been on a strict diet of light foods. The doctor suggested I drink plenty of coconut water, but I dislike it I'm a way autistic people find foods repulsive - it's physically discomforting and my body shudders while it goes ""nope"". I couldn't explain this to doc and dumbly said yes to everything he said.

I want to know if there are any substitutes for coconut water. From what I've read, watermelon is an alternative but isn't in season. Note that I can drink mature coconut water (from dried, brown coconuts) but not render coconut. Will ORS suffice? How much can be too much?

48322,Post-stroke (very small one) and am conflicted about starting statins,"Hello~
I (F) had an ischemic stroke in the left vertebral artery 18 months ago (just turned 50 at the time). It was very small—not a TIA, but such a small stroke there was doubt about what it was at all. I am 5”6 (168 cm) and bounce between 145-160 lbs (66-73 kg). 

My Habits:
I smoked lightly off and on (mostly off) from age 15 into my early 30s. (Much of this was sneaking around behind parents, boyfriends, or just party-puffing when drinking with friends; maybe a total of 8 years of smoking.) I quit smoking for good 15 years ago. 

I drank rarely for last 10 years or so but drank nightly this past Sep - Oct during and after illness and death in my family. I had been on an anti-inflammatory diet for years but it’s been a dietary bacchanalia that I am now getting back in control. 


What happened with the stroke:

Initial CT and MRI reports showed encephalopathy, but no stroke, but after reading my description of symptoms, neuro looked at images again, and saw something. Symptoms were: Feeling like I was in a glass box that was turned on its side but my body hadn’t followed. I tried to stand and felt like left side of head had been pulled to ground, and fell on face. Couldn’t walk or speak for ~two minutes. Left side of face was numb. Just prior I said to husband, “Something is happening in my brain.” He told me I looked blank, then fell. I had had an intractable five-day migraine just prior and had taken the daily max of Relpax for four days, which I had never had to do before, as well as various NSAIDs, hot and cold treatments, etc., etc. 

The feeling did not come back in my face for a couple weeks, and I still had noticeable aphasia at last home nursing follow up appointment four months later, and memory is still an issue now.

Current health conditions:

I have been diagnosed with (with regular labs and imaging), and am being treated for: Primary Hypothyroidism, Non-Familial Hypogammaglobulinemia, Sjögrens Syndrome, some other conditions and some other autoimmune diagnoses, plus a couple others I’m being regularly screened for. Primary daily symptoms are chronic musculoskeletal pain and a fatigue crash every two hours or so. (I think of myself as a healthy person, but technically I’m not, I guess.) 

I am on a well-monitored, but ridiculous amount of medications to manage these conditions. I’d like to avoid more.

Post-stroke I started walking a lot, and have redoubled my anti-inflammatory efforts vía lifestyle and dietary changes. (Until the last four months).

My quandary:

Because I am post-CVA, I have gone round and round with my neurologists and general practitioners about statins. I finally convinced them that I understood the risks of not taking them, and they let it go. But now I have a new primary care physician and the statins arrived in the mail today. 

I have been reading research abstracts on NIH.gov for the last three hours and I am not seeing the information I need. I know that stopping statins can increase risk of stroke but I don’t see studies of those who never started them at all. And there seems to be conflicting information in general. 

The bottom line is I don’t have room for more muscle pain or more cognitive and memory issues, and I don’t want to take another damned pill. 

*MY QUESTION*

So my question is this: If you were in this situation, what would you do? Not what you would advise your patients to do, but what YOU yourself would do. Would you take the statin?

Thank you so much for reading and for any feedback you provide.","As my username implies, I would take a statin in this situation. 

There is ample evidence of the kind you are looking for - which compares people who took statins with people who didn't with regard to stroke prevention. I wouldn't bother reading abstracts of individual studies, the best place to go for something like this is a meta-analysis which summarizes all the research ever done on the topic. [This]( is a good example, a very comprehensive study commissioned by the US government to survey the role of statins in prevention. In one section, it says ""fatal or nonfatal stroke (13 trials; RR, 0.71 after 6 months to 6 years"", which means that there was an average 29% reduction in the incidence of stroke over the next 6 months to 6 years in the 13 trials which have been done on the topic. 

I understand your fear regarding side effects. This meta-analysis also discusses this issue in the paragraph ""Harms of Statin Treatment"". To summarize the relevant paragraph, statins are well tolerated and are not shown to cause any significant side effects, including muscle aches or cognitive issues. I understand there is a lot of bad press regarding statins with a lot of very vocal patient groups out there on the internet, but in the real world we see minimal issues with statins when used in very large numbers of our patients. 

If you are still concerned re side effects, a reasonable compromise is to take a low dose statin. There is a world of difference between 80mg of atorvastatin and 5mg of rosuvastatin in terms of risk of side effects, and the cholesterol lowering of 5mg of rosuvastatin is actually still quite good. For my patients who have concerns or bad experiences re the higher doses, I usually suggest 5mg of rosuvastatin and have never had a patient who had issues with this. 

In terms of risk vs benefit, the risks of statins are extremely low compared to the benefit of a roughly 1/3 reduction in your chances of having a strokes. Strokes are terrible, and if I was in your situation I'd do everything I can to avoid one.","Post-stroke (very small one) and am conflicted about starting statins

4280,Anxiety and meddling mother in law have me paranoid my son(3) has sepsis...,"Hello, I have pretty severe generalized anxiety disorder, and am hoping someone on here can help me sleep a little easier and tell me whether I should be worried about sepsis with my son.

My son was diagnosed with pneumonia two months ago, and it was treated with antibiotics. After a few days of the antibiotics his symptoms improved, but even after following the full course he had a lingering dry cough. The cough wasn't severe and only seemed to happen at night so my husband and I assumed it was due to the dry air and haven't thought much more of the whole incident.

On Friday he began feeling under the weather again, with a stomach ache, nasal congestion, and a cough. He didn't have a fever so we assumed he had just picked up a cold from preschool. 

Saturday and Sunday  were similar to Friday, but he then started to develop a low-grade fever (100-101.5), loss of appetite, and became lethargic. Again, we assumed this was just due to having a cold.

On Monday, he took a dramatic turn for the worse-At this point he hadn't eaten since Sunday morning (no appetite) he spent most of the day sleeping, his cough was much worse, and his fever had risen to 102.7. He also began breathing very rapidly and vomiting, and went eight hours without urinating. His heart rate and breathing worried me so we brought him to the E.R. They did not take any blood, but monitored him while he drank fluids and gave him some ibuprofen to lower his fever. They tested him for the flu which was negative, and gave him a chest x-ray which also did not show signs of pneumonia. They then put him on antibiotics(azithromycin) and sent us home with the instructions to continue the antibiotics and ibuprofen to control the fever as needed.

On Tuesday he showed minimal improvement- he still had a fever (101 with ibuprofen), his appetite hadn't returned and he still wasn't producing urine. The cough also seemed to be getting worse.

Wednesday he continued to improve, with a low grade fever, and some of his appetite returning. By the end of the afternoon he was looking to be a lot better(although the cough is still unchanged)

Today he looked great (minus dark sunken eyes which I assume is from being overtired) and is back to his usual self. No fever, but the cough is  persisting. I did still give him Tylenol because his throat is so sore that every time he coughs he cries.

I know the fact that he is doing better should be a relief, but the fact that he had a fever and looked so incredibly sick without an obvious cause is really worrying me. I guess my main question is does any of this sound consistent with sepsis? Could he still have it and only be feeling better because he is on antibiotics? I'm just afraid that he only looks better because of the medication but the underlying cause of his symptoms are still there. Should I be worried about something more serious since the cough won't go away?

Any help/ insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance!!","So generally speaking, of all the symptoms of a pneumonia or flu, cough is often the last one to go. Sometimes it can even take weeks for the cough to go away. We call it a post-infectious or residual cough and it is normal. 
Sepsis is something different. Sepsis occurs when an infection has spread to the bloodstream and the resulting infection and inflammatory response start to cause harm to your organs. If your child has improved and is now almost back to his normal self with the exception of the residual cough, he is not septic. It sounds like whatever infection he had has cleared. Antibiotics will help clear up a bacterial infection, and time will help clear up a viral infection, but neither will ""mask"" symptoms of something hidden.

35975,Is my boyfriend unstable,"
(For starters, my boyfriend has never hurt me physically mentally or emotionally. While he can be distant he is also very sweet and attached in his own way.)

To be blunt my boyfriend (16m) has almost no friends. He has me and his old friend from primary. That's it. He had this sweet hearted menace of a dog that he was very close with but passed away last year. He's a bit of a punk; shaved head, worn combat boots, patch jacket. When I first met him through a friend he was quite intimidating, saying violent things out of the blue (not to me) and then being as quiet and as cold as a fucking rock for days. He was very shut off about his home life, didn't dare tell anyone his address and hated people asking. But once we started talking and sending dumb pictures and messages and jokes to each other I noticed stuff. Like he sleeps on a matress with one sheet. Has an ass awful relationship with his 19 yr old sibling (steals money and clothes, spits on him, hits him) and absent father. I don't know if these things impacted his mind in some way or if his family has a history of mental issues.

Strike one was the holes in his wall. I thought hey, teen dudes fuckn do that. Then he kicked a hole in his garden shed. I though hey, maybe he just needs some help with some anger issues. Then he set part of his school on fire. The principle pitied him and didn't call the police but sent him to mandatory counselling. For which he just sat there mute for 10 sessions. Turns out he was also the one who set the park near to his house on fire. And broke into the slaughterhouse with a golf club and stole a fucking jacket. Then sent me a video of him burning the jacket on the railway.

By then I was thinking, This isn't good, but maybe I can help him out of these violent episodes. No. He has on his knuckles (mostly) from punching stuff. When I saw him get undressed for a shower I saw some bite marks down his forearms. I've seen him 'cool down' the metal on his lighter by pressing it to his calf. I had to beg him to put a bird down once because he was bending its wings backwards. He catches mice and rats in his room and then stomps on them or cuts their heads off with scissors. When he still had his dog (she was very very kind, just loved to chase things) she was catch larger birds by the wings and he would hold them by their necks like rag dolls. He climbed in through his neighbours window into a little girls room and took one of her picture books while the family was in a different part of the house. I think he's the reason why two cats in his neighbourhood went missing.

Sometimes he says delusional things, like that he's god. Or that the devil sometimes strangles him in his sleep. He sometimes shows strong suicidal tendencies. I feel like Ive been watching him deteriorate right in front of me for the past year and I haven't been able to do anything. Im so fucking worried he's going to kill himself, or maybe even put someone else in the hospital and go to prison. He's so talented at like fucking maths and music and I'm seeing it all go to waste. When I say he may need help he looks hurt and sometimes gets angry. Saying he's not ""sick"". Really needed to get this off my chest, options and suggestions are welcome.

Should I be more forceful? Will this stop or just get worse?

5260,Wife had a brain aneurysm during surgery. Chances of survival and other questions.,"Age: 32
Sex: female
Height: 5’2 
Weight: 120 lb prior to pregnancy, unsure during pregnancy (was 33 weeks pregnant)
Race: Caucasian
Duration of complaint: history of 8 years but current complaint since the 27th of May
Location (Geographic and on body): Hawaii, brain
Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): had a stroke eight years ago and a small clot treated 3 years ago
Current medications (if any): a seizure medication and a beta blocker (unsure of names) 
Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example)

Hello, it was suggested that I post here seeking a possible second opinion about my wife’s condition.

8 years ago when we were first married she suffered a stroke but made a complete recovery but was treated with a seizure medication and a beta blocker to prevent complications. She later had a small blood clot removed from her brain surgically with no complications 3 years ago. 

On the 25th of May when she was 33 weeks pregnant with our fourth child, she began experiencing symptoms that were similar to those of her first stroke with intense headache, numbness and had a small seizure. I took her to the emergency department and it was determined that she had a blood clot that needed to be operated on and that they needed to deliver the baby. They delivered the baby and transferred my wife to a different hospital where her clot could be surgically treated. The day before surgery she seemed normal. She was complaining of pain and numbness but seemed like herself still. She was smiling, making jokes and ordering me to go back to be with our baby rather than stay with her. On the 27th of May she underwent the surgery. During the surgery the aneurysm ruptured. It was a lot bigger than they previously thought.

Currently, my wife is in ICU on life support. Her doctors say that most likely she won’t survive and that if she does the effects will be devastating and she won’t be the same. 

The chances of her surviving her first stroke were only 40% and the chances of having almost no side effects were less than 1% and she came through. She came through the second surgery with ease too. I guess what I’m asking is if there’s a chance that this could be wrong or that her brain could heal itself. I saw the MRI and I understand how serious it is, a large portion of her brain was decimated by the rupture, but I want to know if there’s any chance at all that she could recover from this. Can the brain heal itself from an aneurysm? I’m not ready to say goodbye to her. She’s so young and our kids are all under 7.","Neurologist here. It sounds like she had a dural venous sinus thrombosis at first - a blood clot in the veins surrounding the brain. Pregnant women tend to be at greater risk for clotting in general. Then it seems the doctors attempted to evacuate that clot but that there was a complication during the procedure. She isn't likely to have an independently-existing aneurysm which just so happened to rupture in the context of all of this. It's quite rare for 30-year-olds to have that problem anyway. The extent of injury from the bleed sounds severe, and it is impossible to say more without additional details and the images of the CT scans or MRI scans, but she is young and could recover, albeit with deficits ... And it'll be a long road ahead. I'm very sorry for this. It sounds like a horrible situation all around. I wish you and your family healing.","Wife had a brain aneurysm during surgery.

Thank you. ","Unlikely the coughing or medications.

39192,Does everyone have a xiphoid process? [34M],"**Age - 34**

**Height - 5' 8""**

**Location (Geographic and on body) - Just below sternum**

**Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) - N/A**

**Current medications (if any) - N/A**

**Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example) - N/A**

Now that we have the essentials out of the way I wanted to ask about how common the presence of a xiphoid process is. Last year I weighed an all time high of 181lbs. I just lost 30lbs since the start of 2021 as part of an effort to lead a healthier life following a few years of weight gain and unusual physical exertion (corresponding to several consecutive years going through unusually demanding military training). After losing this weight recently I noticed for the first time in my life that I have this lump right under my sternum. It is not externally visible (therefore no picture available) however I can feel it with my hand. It feels like a tube maybe 3"" or so in length and slightly rounded/spherical at the bottom. Unlike the rest of my sternum it doesn't feel quite like bone although it is fairly tough. It feels like fairly solid cartilage. It's not painful but if I push on it it does create some discomfort. Due to career implications I have not had a medical professional look at it. Initial research makes me think it's just a regular xiphoid process however I don't ever recall feeling this on my body or being aware of it at any other point in my life including when I was younger and at (or below) my current weight. It doesn't protrude really but it's not *quite* flush with the rest of my sternum.

My question is essentially two-fold - 1) does this sound like a xiphoid process? and 2) How common is this? I read that it can appear and solidify over the course of one's adulthood but would that really happen at 34yo?

TIA!","Yes you would not believe how many emergency appointments for ""abdominal mass"" I've had that turn out to be a xiphoid process! Everyone has one, some are more prominent than others, recent fat loss is a common story for finding it for the first time.

I am 20 years old, female, caucasian and live in germany...

I won't list all my symptoms as some are more small issues like cancer sores and dry scaly skin...

I don't know what to do anymore... 2 year ago it began with burning in my mouth, numb limbs, wound healing problems, frequent headaches that lasted for several days ( I rarely had any headaches before) sudden weight loss, heart palpations and a strong pain under my left ribs, at that point they found an elevated blood sugar (No family history of diabetes, tested negative for diabetes, always been slim and healthy) and low potassium. I got two potassium tablets and everything was alright for another 3 weeks, then everything went to shit and I was bedridden for several weeks, I could barely move, sleep, walking short distances gave me a fever, I was constantly nauseaus and sometimes had a very bad stomach.

I started taking vitamin b supplements and my condition improved a fair bit, but it never really got better since, I still can barely eat, I still get numb limbs or even an entire numb half of my lower body, all the other symptoms are still there aswell, some only got better thanks to supplements like vitamin b and magnesium (which took almost all my headaches for example)

I was at two hospitals where they did a colonoscopy and two gastroscopies, my stomach lining turned out to be inflamed and I got put on PPIs (pantroprazole, which I take till this day) but it never got better, I only eat a small variety of very bland stuff since 1 1/2 years now and even that my stomach cannot really handle...

The first doc I went to said it was just a flu and sent me away, the next one suspected me be a simple case of a drug addict because of how shabby I looked and sent me away with acid blockers.. the next two were homeopaths, one who my mother recommended me to go to told me to ""just start eating again"" after my mother stated blurting out about ""how I have always been a strange child"".... I tried eating regular stuff again but it did not work out at all...

The next one wanted to diagnose me with a pendulum.. .yeah.

Since no doc so far could find anything apart from too low vitamin D, too high TSH ( around 5.50 ), slightly elevated blood sugar, re-occuring low potassium and a vitamin b12 level being a little low despite taking supplements for several months ... I was sent to a psychotherapist to which I go to since over half a year now, but I didn't have any mental problems when it started, in fact I was very happy and I always knew when something lingered on my mind, so far my therapist is clueless aswell because.. well there doesn't seem to be anything in my head either that could cause my symptoms...

My mother for some reason keeps telling the doctors that I ""have always been weird in the head as a child"" and now wants me to go to a psych clinic, she even threatens me to kick me out if I don't go and.. it is just all a big pile of shit, by now, yes I have depressions now, but because of all this crap, this isn't the cause of my health, it is caused by my health being shit ffs... but when I tell her that she just says how ""My mental health is not to be ignored"" yeah.. of course and I wouldn't have anything against going there if it wasn't for me wanting to fucking feel physically better and not get into even more debt because of that clinic...

Last week she bought baby food to get me used to other foods apart from potatoes, steamed veggies, bananas, gruel, dry toast and such stuff again, the first jar went well, the second one gave me this horrible stabbing pain between my left ribs again.... It has gotten better since, but not gone.. a few jars later I ate one that made my stomach feel like exploding it was just carrots, potatoes and peas... well I almost threw up twice that night and my stomach feels like it is about to burst almost all the time the days after... It increased my nausea aswell, the symptoms get worse after I eat of course...

My stomach could barely handle anything at that point because I felt constantly like I had just eaten a huge menu, combine with the stabbing pain in my side... I ate some kind of semolina porridge for babies that day and I had experienced bad stomach/abdominal cramps the past two days already, but that day it got so bad... I think I never was in so much pain, ever.

2-3 hours after eating it started and got rapidly worse until I was lying in my bed just curling into a ball through those waves of horrible cramps... I lay there for one hour when I suddenly also got horrible diarrhea, so I spent the rest of the night lying in bed enduring the pain and on the toilet..

3 days have passed now and I just feel so horrible, my stomach feels like a big cramped together ball, it hurts and I feel so full, I am often hungry but my stomach just hurts and feels so full... I try to eat but the feeling just worsens... even now, just sitting here writing this, my stomach feels like a fist clenched together so hard that it hurts and sometimes stings..

My mother wouldn't allow me to see another doctor so after a few months I finally got her to allow me to visit a new doc.. but this is my last chance and the doctor who had really good reviews is already full until next year...

I don't know what I should do, really, I feel so terrible, I sometimes get chest aches which scare me and my stomach hurts almost all day the past days.. today I woke up with abdominal pain, it is frustrating and tiresome...

I am 20 years old, female, caucasian and live in germany...

I won't list all my symptoms as some are more small issues like cancer sores and dry scaly skin...

I don't know what to do anymore... 2 year ago it began with burning in my mouth, numb limbs, wound healing problems, frequent headaches that lasted for several days ( I rarely had any headaches before) sudden weight loss, heart palpations and a strong pain under my left ribs, at that point they found an elevated blood sugar (No family history of diabetes, tested negative for diabetes, always been slim and healthy) and low potassium. I got two potassium tablets and everything was alright for another 3 weeks, then everything went to shit and I was bedridden for several weeks, I could barely move, sleep, walking short distances gave me a fever, I was constantly nauseaus and sometimes had a very bad stomach.

I started taking vitamin b supplements and my condition improved a fair bit, but it never really got better since, I still can barely eat, I still get numb limbs or even an entire numb half of my lower body, all the other symptoms are still there aswell, some only got better thanks to supplements like vitamin b and magnesium (which took almost all my headaches for example)

I was at two hospitals where they did a colonoscopy and two gastroscopies, my stomach lining turned out to be inflamed and I got put on PPIs (pantroprazole, which I take till this day) but it never got better, I only eat a small variety of very bland stuff since 1 1/2 years now and even that my stomach cannot really handle...

Asking this for my boyfriend. Let me preface this by saying that he isnt antivax whatsoever, he has just been kind of lazy about getting his vaccine. He went into work today and got his temp with a new thermometer that was a forehead scan type, and it said he had a fever of just a little over 100, his other coworkers scanned fine so he went home.

20562,Abdominal pain in upper right quadrant after eating large/fatty meals,"3 years ago I began to experience pain in the upper right abdomen after eating large or fatty meals.  This pain would come up every few months or so and would last a few days.  I believe fatty foods trigger it.  During those few days, the pain worsens after eating.  I would characterize it as mild to mild-moderate blunt pain  The pain has worsened mildly over the years.  

The exact location is 1-2 inches right of the ziphoid process and under the ribcage.  If I hunch forward or flex my abdomen the pain worsens.  

I went to the doctor about a year ago and had an ultrasound of the gallbladder and there were no abnormalities.  Blood work looked normal.  I was only seen by a pediatric doctor and the ultrasound tech, not an IM specialist.  

Background: 23 Asian male 5'10"" 145lbs. United States.  

I have a grandparent with mild gallbladder issues.   

I occasionally took illegal drugs(marijuana, lsd, cocaine, kit tested mdma) when I was younger(15-21).  Never took any drugs intravenously.  I currently drink mildly.  (2-3 drinks once or twice a month).  One or two instances of binge drinking a year when I was 17-21.

Ive only had sex with a handul partners in long term relationships.  

I gained around 5-10 pounds since symptoms started 3 years ago.  

I used to take Tylenol often for headaches when I was a child/teenager.  Once I accidentally took around 2x the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen when I took norco + Tylenol after wisdom teeth surgery when I was 16 (4 years before the pain appeared).  I didn't  experience any issues indicating overdose at that time.

Dear doctors of Reddit. I am 20 years old and recently lost my lovely dearest mother who was 46 years to cancer in January and now have only my father as closest family. My whole life as long as I can remember my father has had gray hair and wrinkles (the normal amount a (50-60 y/o male has), but the last year I have noticed that he looks more tired, walks differently, has more dry skin, has less muscle and in general looks more grown up than before, if I can say it that way. I have a huge fear of something happening to him and we weekly talk about his health and he tells me what he eats, the places he has gone for a walk and when he will take PSA tests next time, so we talk very often about health. My father eats fairly healthy, walks every day, drinks fish oil and lives hopefully as I see a good life, I am just so fucking terrified of something happening to him because I lost all my grandparents at the age of 75-84 and my dad is turning 70 in two years. Is there anything I can do to help him or recommend to him? Maybe he should weight train and build muscle to reduce the chances of falling and breaking a bone \*knock on wood\*, maybe he should drink more water or should I buy him a face cream so that he can have a good barrier for his immune system? Do elder people have to take any supplements specifically for their age? I met my father today after not seeing him for four months and I have gradually noticed that the way he smells reminds me more and more of the way my grandparents smelled. It is not any bad at all and I think the smell is very lovely, I am just so afraid that his body starts to go through so many changes and stars to prepare to stop functioning??? My father is very hygienic, so the smell is from the nonenal process and not from lack of hygiene, but should he take any supplements or incorporate something into his life to support his health and this process of the body? I am just so afraid of not having him with me and I can't even fall asleep thinking of these bad things. With all my hearth I wish for him to live a long an happy life and I am afraid he stresses a lot about me and my younger sister because she goes through primary school drama and I try to end my life like the brat I am every other week. I have started my best doing my part to relief his stress that comes due to my personal problems, I just hope any doctor who has the time and energy can help me with these questions.","Okay, to address all of your questions buried in your long paragraph:

>I  am 20 years old and recently lost my lovely dearest mother who was 46 years to cancer in January and now have only my father as closest family.

I am so sorry to hear that. Losing a parent at any age is hard, but I can imagine especially so as you transition between adolescence to young adulthood.

>when he will take PSA tests next time

For what it's worth, the recommendation behind routine PSA screening is controversial. The current United States Preventive Service Task Force recommendation is to leave the decision to screen up to the individual patient and his doctor. The reasoning is that there is a high rate of false positives, i.e. a cancer scare, that turns out to be negative. However, the workup for a cancer scare comes with the risk of complications and patients get harmed.

>Is there anything I can do to help him or recommend to him?

Yes, see an internal medicine, family medicine, or geriatric doctor (more info later) for an annual physical and ask what recommendations the doctors has to stay healthy. The rest of your post has a number of health myths or outdated medical advice that I will address.

>Maybe he should weight train and build muscle to reduce the chances of falling and breaking a bone \*knock on wood\*, maybe he should drink more water or should I buy him a face cream so that he can have a good barrier for his immune system?

Yes, regular weight-bearing exercises are good to help the elderly keep their muscle tone and prevent falls. Getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise (moderate pace walking, jogging, running, swimming bicycling, etc.) is also recommended to keep the heart healthy, keep blood pressure and cholesterol normal, and improve mood. As far as bone health goes, evidence for checking vitamin D and replacing vitamin D if low in otherwise healthy community-dwelling elderly adults to prevent falls is lacking. Unless he has another condition that increases his risk of bone fractures, he does not need any other tests, e.g. DEXA scan of his bones for osteoporosis.

Drinking a healthy amount of water is always a good idea; however,  it's hard to recommend how much water to drink and without knowing if your dad has an underlying diagnoses that would point him away from drinking too much water, i.e. chronic heart, lung, or liver disease. I will say that as people age, their thirst drive does diminish and the elderly have to be reminded to drink water or else they risk dehydration.

To my knowledge, there isn't evidence behind the benefits of face cream. Minimizing exposure to the sun, covering up skin,  regular use of sunscreen, and annual thorough skin exam (EVERY single centimeter of the skin) to prevent skin cancer is the general skin recommendation.

>Do elder people have to take any supplements specifically for their age?

As long as they're eating a balanced diet, i.e. a mostly plant-based whole grain diet, there's no evidence of nutritional deficiencies, and their weight is stable, then no. Don't waste your money on supplements.

>I met my father today after not seeing him for four months and I have gradually noticed that the way he smells reminds me more and more of the way my grandparents smelled.

[2-Nonenal]( is the smell associated with aging. As far as I know, it's benign.

>should he take any supplements or incorporate something into his life to support his health and this process of the body?

No, see above.

Unless your dad hasn't seen a doctor in years, he sounds otherwise healthy. Any internal medicine or family medicine doctor in a clinic can help him stay healthy. There are specialist doctors for the elderly called geriatricians that can be harder to find, but they specialize in the special needs of the elderly. However, this is usually the frail, limited mobility, and/or 3+ comorbid medical problems and prescription medications kind of patient. I have geriatric patients on my internal medicine primary care panel of patients who I am very comfortable managing.

It is still ***very*** early, but I would have your dad start thinking about how he wants to best live the rest of his life. Does he want to travel? Spend as much time with his family? What does he want to happen if he were to fall ill? Should doctors try to resuscitate him with chest compressions and put a breathing tube down his throat and have a machine breathe for him if he were not able to anymore? He should start to think about a living will or advanced directive ([an example]( if he wants to be prepared. This really far down the line, but as you are alluding to, the human body doesn't recover as well as it ages and I wouldn't want the family to have to make these sort of decisions if something unexpected were to happen to your dad and he cannot make decisions for himself in that setting.","My dad is becoming older and I want him to live a healthy life and not worry about him

22270,30M - Why isnt the shingrix vaccine approved for people < 50 years old?,"Shingles [seems to be a real problem]( \- with PHN and Opt PHN being serious complications. There are no recorded cases of severe reactions in the trials - and its very effective. Theres I doubt an immune system based reason for giving it to young people and the incidence rate is really high (close to some cancers for older people).

Given this - Im surprised we don't give the vaccine starting at 30! It seems an end to end win - any idea why that might be? Im considering paying out of pocket - so wanted to check if there was a real medical/biological reason for this","My guess, and this is merely an educated guess, based on knowing stuff about vaccination etc.:

the 50 year recommendation is an old recommendation, based on population studies when chicken pox was still endemic (constantly circulating).  With the advent of the chicken pox vaccine, we are not getting re-exposed to chicken pox as often as we used to, which previously helped keep our immunity high.  

When we get a shingles outbreak, we think it's  when our immunity to varicella virus has waned enough that it can reactivate from dormancy in our nerves. (we don't know exactly how it works) 

[ 

shows that in those of us over 30, who likely had wild-type zoster (meaning we got chicken pox, prior to there being a vaccine available) are perhaps increasing our rates of shingles by a very small amount.  Under 30, there's not the rise, because the vaccine has lower rates of shingles, thankfully, than getting it naturally.  

So, if we are getting less exposure to maintain our immunity and shingles appears when our immunity wanes, it is a fairly logical deduction that perhaps those of us who are over thirty should perhaps get a shingles vaccine earlier than previously recommended.  BUT the immunity from the shingles vaccine wanes too, so if you get it earlier than recommended, there is a risk that it will leave you unprotected when the risks are even higher in your 70s.  And your risk of shingles under the age of 50 is still very low.  

In other words, it's not as clear cut as we think logically, and (despite antivaxxer's claims LOL), they try and give people the fewest immunizations as possible, especially because the more complicated you make it, the more likely someone is going to not get a needed dose when it is even more important.  

So getting the shingles vax at 30 might decrease your risk at 30-40 by 1-2%, but increases your risk at 75 or 80 by 30-40%.  That's not a good trade off, especially because your immune system in your 30s and 40s is strong enough that it will likely be able to deal with the shingles without any permanent issues - not true when you're older.  

It's an awkward stage to be in, I think, because of the advent of chicken pox vaccination, and by the time we figure it out conclusively, the younger end of those who got chicken pox naturally will have already gotten the shingles vaccine at 50.  

TLDR: It might give some small amount of help, but it could be concerning for raising your risks for shingles when you are much older, or may need another round of shingles vaccine (which has not been studied)  

again though, based on rates of incidence, your overall risk of shingles is so low before 50, so it just may be overkill. 

Please take this with lots of salts and caveats, I am not an immunologist nor infectious disease expert nor doing research in this topic, it's a personal area of curiosity and there is definitely some extrapolation going on here, and if someone with real expertise contradicts me, they are almost certainly right!","30M - Why isnt the shingrix vaccine approved for people < 50 years old?

Been dealing with a ""headache"" for basically the past 2 weeks. I hesitate to call it a headache because I can describe it more as a ""pressure"" that can be felt diffusely throughout my head, and ""behind"" my ears from time to time (as if theres a bubble in my head and I need to equalize my ear pressure). I've also had what I'd consider to be low grade tinnitus for the past year or two, definitely before this headache stuff started however sometimes I feel as if the tinnitues is worse from time to time. The pain is never worse than a 1 or a 2, doesn't stop me from continuing my daily activities (other than being paranoid and thinking about it a lot), and doesn't seem to be exacerbated or alleviated by anything in particular. If I press certain areas of my temple, there is possibly mild relief, not sure if thats related.

Saw my PCP about it a week ago and he said its likely tension headaches and prescribed imitrex after an unremarkable neuro exam. He said if I still have it when I see him for my annual physical this week, he'd order a CT.

Here's the deal, I broached the topic of ""omg cancer"" when I saw him about it last week and he brushed it off saying thats almost certainly not what I have. Yes yes, 4 years of med school and 4 years of residency I should trust his judgement. However, I'm hesitant to do so because he misdiagnosed an enlarged lymph node I had as a cyst. He's not a bad doctor, I just feel like he isn't as aggresive about my health as I am.

22 y/o south asian male with no significant PMHx. Social drinker, no cigarettes or other drugs.

Been dealing with a ""headache"" for basically the past 2 weeks. I hesitate to call it a headache because I can describe it more as a ""pressure"" that can be felt diffusely throughout my head, and ""behind"" my ears from time to time (as if theres a bubble in my head and I need to equalize my ear pressure). I've also had what I'd consider to be low grade tinnitus for the past year or two, definitely before this headache stuff started however sometimes I feel as if the tinnitues is worse from time to time. The pain is never worse than a 1 or a 2, doesn't stop me from continuing my daily activities (other than being paranoid and thinking about it a lot), and doesn't seem to be exacerbated or alleviated by anything in particular. If I press certain areas of my temple, there is possibly mild relief, not sure if thats related.

Saw my PCP about it a week ago and he said its likely tension headaches and prescribed imitrex after an unremarkable neuro exam. He said if I still have it when I see him for my annual physical this week, he'd order a CT.

Here's the deal, I broached the topic of ""omg cancer"" when I saw him about it last week and he brushed it off saying thats almost certainly not what I have. Yes yes, 4 years of med school and 4 years of residency I should trust his judgement. However, I'm hesitant to do so because he misdiagnosed an enlarged lymph node I had as a cyst. He's not a bad doctor, I just feel like he isn't as aggresive about my health as I am. He's informed me that he can't order an MRI (which is what I asked for, not a big fan of radiation exposure if I don't absolutely need it).

I'm a 27 year old guy whose always had phimosis. My foreskin is not able to retract when fully erect. I've tried the steroid cream and stretching exercises, it didn't work. I'm worried about the following?

1) I've heard that once you are circumsized, that your penis loses sensitivity. Will I this affect my day to day life? I'm not worried about sex. I've already given up on experiencing sex and women, so I'm more concerned about the loss of sensitivity just affecting my daily health and mental well being.

I have an opportunity to get the 9-valent HPV vaccine for free (Gardasil 9). I have received my first COVID vaccine dose (Pfizer) and am supposed to get the second one in five weeks.

Should I wait until I get the second Pfizer dose before I get the HPV vaccine? Is there anything else I should be taking into account when planning the vaccination?

I am also due for a tetanus booster. I have seen that when children of antivaxxers grow up and get vaccinated, they sometimes get up to four shots at once. I don't know which vaccines those are, but I guess one could possibly be for tetanus. Could I get the booster at the same time as, say, the second HPV dose or should I make different appointments?

I've been avoiding using the crutches becuase it's so sore to let the leg dangle downwards.

Whats the best/safest way for me to take Lorazepam without risking addiction ?","It depends on what your definition of addiction is. If you mean addiction in the sense of having a compulsion to take the medication - probably not. You seem to have a good grasp of when to use it and when you should take breaks. That said there can be a tolerance to benzodiazepines that occurs over time if used too frequently (although exactly how frequently varies person to person). This can cause a spiral of increasing dosage which can be very challenging to get out of. This is what people are more likely to develop - a tolerance or dependence where abrupt discontinuation can be challenging due to rebound anxiety (among other things). Generally, benzos are recommended as acute medications which shouldn’t be used for more than a couple of weeks (in an ideal world, in reality this is far from true). Usage above this indicates that you may be better using a mood stabilizing medication such as an SSRI which can help limit your panic disorder and will help reduce your lorazepam usage. I would highly recommend consulting your primary care provider to pursue this treatment option as it is much more sustainable than near daily benzo usage. 

That said, even in a worst case scenario, benzos can be challenging but not impossible to get off of. Generally there is a phased taper off that occurs over several weeks to minimize withdrawal effects.","Doctors, can I get addicted to Lorazepam by taking 1,0mg 4-5 days a week and then having a 2 Day break ?

He didn't want treatment so haven't had any scans since and have just been having 4 monthly meetings with oncologist with the aim of managing symptoms (the calls have been over the phone for the last year due to covid). 
He had some pain in his shoulders, some weight loss, difficulty swallowing and has been coughing up more blood but no other changes until August 2020.
In August, we noticed problems with memory so took him to gp who did the dementia test and referred him to the memory team. They did a phone assessment and said mild to moderate cognitive impairment. He didn't have any scans for this either, his choice.
Since then, he has deteriorated significantly mentally to the point now where he needs 24 hour care. He talks a little but it doesn't make sense, he can't complete basic tasks, he's incontinent, has lost coordination and mobility is really poor. Since December he has lost 14 pound in weight, he doesn't eat anymore, hardly drinks, has been coughing up thick sticky phlegm and spits up most time he tries to swallow anything. 
I spoke to oncologist for routine appointment in Oct and mentioned his cognitive decline but nothing was mentioned about possible brain tumour and we continued investigation of the confusion with the memory team as possible dementia made worse by infections that were never tested for or confirmed. Antibiotics were prescribed but didn't improve the situation.
In the last month his decline has been very bad, especially in the past two weeks. He is becoming agitated and aggressive and hallucinating at times.
I spoke to the memory team on Wednesday and they said we should rule out his cancer as the cause. 
I spoke to oncologist the next day who said symptoms sound like a brain mets and his prognosis is very poor and to arrange hospice care immediately.
He has been seen by the palliative care team who have said he looks stable and like death is not imminent so he should remain at home and also, they don't think it's a brain mets as he doesn't have headaches. The memory team say it's the cancer, the oncologist said he is about to die so get him to a hospice, the gp has prescribed end of life medication just in case but the palliative care nurse who is the only one who has seen him face to face has said he is stable and it's likely dementia rather than a brain mets.
We discussed a scan with oncologist to understand prognosis bit they said there isn't time for one and he isn't well enough.
Can you help me to understand what's going on? Is it dementia that has simply progressed really quickly or is this a brain tumor? For a brain tumour, should there be headache, seizures, one sided weakness etc?

15998,Really need help. Doctors have no clue.,"Hi everyone. I’ve seen many doctors and none of them have been able to help me, all of them are scratching their heads. Some seem like they don’t care. 

Information:

* 59M 
* 230 pounds 
* Caucasian 


- Relevant medical issues: 
* partially torn Achilles’ tendon.
* high stress levels
* intestinal polyps were found at my last colonoscopy
* sleep apnea  


For the past year I’ve had this very painful sensation in my left foot. Interesting thing is that this shooting pain only occurs when I need to use the restroom. (Bowel Movement). When the urge to go to the bathroom comes, a pain shoots down my foot. 

I’ve seen many doctors for this issue and none have seen anything like it. They don’t know why bowel movements would cause foot pain. Some say it might have to do with a spinal nerve issue? 

Is fibromyalgia a possibility? 

Anything helps so if you have any suggestions please comment. 

Thank you!","Ok. There may be a possible explanation for this. The pain you describe matches sciatica - pain emerging from irritation / compression of the sciatic nerve. This is in most cases caused by a disc bulge / hernia. There are a few causes outside the spine that can irritate this nerve though. 

After the nerve exits the lower spine, it passes on the inside of the pelvic bottom before it goes further down in the thigh. In the pelvic bottom, the sciatic nerve lies only a few cm away from the rectum. It is actually a known fact that constipation can cause sciatica in some patients. This is because in constipation, the rectal ampulla can be so dilated from stool inside, that the nerve becomes compressed between the rectum and bones in the pelvis. 

You may have some sort of anatomic variant that makes you disposed to this kind of sciatica - the rectum may lie further to the left side than is normal, or the nerve has less ""fat-cushoning"" than normal. It's not impossible that something simple - like changing your diet to fiber-rich, or anything else to loosen up your stool, can help with the pain. You could try a laxative, and see if the pain is less when the stool is soft. 

I would also suggest you have a CT with iv contrast of your pelvis, just to make sure there isn't anything very unusual around the rectum. In some rare cases pain like this could be caused by a tumor, though unlikely since you've had a colonoscopy. You could discuss this theory with your primary doctor, and if he agrees he could order a CT.","Really need help. Doctors have no clue.

6348,Lump directly below left breast (on top of rib cage),"Hi Reddit docs!

Two days ago, I was laying on my bed on my back and had an itch at the top of my rib cage. Once I scratched it, I immediately felt a lump. I'd say it's about the size of a nickel or maybe quarter. It seems to be more oval than round but it's hard to tell. The lump is directly below my left breast and seems to be sitting right on top of my upper rib.

I went to the doctor, who referred me for an ultrasound, which I have scheduled for tomorrow. 

I'm a nervous wreck. I had Hodgkin's Lymphoma 6 years ago and thankfully have been in remission since, but obviously after going through that any sort of lump immediately puts me on alert. My doctor mentioned it may be a lipoma or perhaps a lymph node (gulp), but said there is just no way to know without further testing. She was glad I came in and that we are able to investigate further. Needless to say, it wasn't exactly the ""oh, nothing to worry about!"" that I was hoping for.

Obviously I'm not a doctor, but I've never heard of lymph nodes in this area. Does anyone have input on what it might be? Would this technically still be considered breast tissue even though it's directly below my breast? Please see below for the location. The lump is in between my pointer and middle fingers:

[

Some other helpful info: I'm a 33 year old female, my original HL was in my supraclavicular nodes (left side) and also in my chest. I'm also 20 weeks pregnant (maybe it's a hormone thing?!?!?! I hope...) and received my first dose of Moderna 2 weeks ago.

Aside from the lump I feel fine and have no other symptoms. 

Thanks for your input.","Usually no lymph nodes in that area.
This exact problem - bumps somewhere on the rib cage - is common. At least it seems so from my point of view, since I get lots of referrals similar to yours. I cannot remember the last time a lump such as you describe turned out to be a malignant tumor. Usually it's a small lipoma, a slight asymmetry of the rib cage / rib cartilage that they randomly noticed even though they've probably had it since birth, and in some cases we don't find anything at all even with MRI, possibly it's just an unevenness in subcutaneous fat.

So, while I can't say for sure what you have, I wouldn't be too worried.","Lump directly below left breast (on top of rib cage)

1507,My dad is in constant back pain and its only getting worse.,"About 5 years ago, by dad was building a shed and he tweaked his back putting in paving stones for the foundation. 

Ever since then, the muscles in his back have constantly been in pain. He says that the upper back muscles often go into spasm and stay locked up for long periods of time, its really painful. He's in chronic pain everyday and I know it's eating away at him, he's gained weight and he doesn't sleep well anymore.

He's been to multiple doctors and chiropractors and there hasn't really been a solution outside of bi-weekly therapy that hasn't made an improvement yet. He'll see a chiro for 6 months and see little to no improvement, right now we cant afford them anymore.

One of the doctors recommended that he takes enough muscle relaxants just to manage with minimal pain and push through a moderate stretching and cardio routine. He hasn't tried it yet, probably because he's scared of the recovery pain and is just tired after work.

I'm sort of desperate to find a course of action that he'll be willing to start. I know he obviously wants to feel better, but he's done little physically so far due to the pain. He'll take over the counter muscle relaxants if the pain is especially bad, which he says helps a little, but little else other than that. We've also tried massaging the problem muscles, which we don't do often because it's painful for him and it makes a minimal difference. The muscles that lock up are right under both shoulder blades, and on the small of both sides of his back.

Now listen, I realize at this point that there likely isn't going some easy change that doesn't require some major lifestyle tweaks, but I want to get him started doing *something* that will help him in the long run, something that wont be too overwhelming right off the bat.

The problem is confirmed muscular. He works a 9 - 5 desk job and is relatively sedentary all day.

- muscle relaxants and pain meds can help muscles relax, because pain causes rendition causes more pain causes more tension ...

from the second i wake up to the second i fall asleep, i have a headache. it gets worse and better throughout the day but it never goes away. medicine helps a little bit once it wears off it’s back. it’s starting to get to the point where i can’t take it anymore. this has been happening for months.. i told my doctor and she didn’t know.. also i get these days where my chest feels super tight and like i can’t breathe. idk what that’s from either. any advice?","Can I ask, what do you take the kratom for?

Rebound headaches are definitely a possibility. Under-treated anxiety and depression both can cause significant issues with headaches (and can cause chest tightness, or feeling like you can’t breathe).

You really do need to see your doc again for this,  as unfortunately there’s too many potential causes to be narrowed down, and you need a physical exam at least of your heart and lungs.

26749,Really need a doctor’s advice- my mom can only eat four foods without feeling excruciating physical pain throughout my entire body.,"She has tried an onslaught of different tests, has been resorting to homeopathic medicine, and we are quickly losing hope and fearing for her wellbeing and longevity.

My mom has been battling this for 6 years now, while it has gotten progressively worse. She started feeling intense, excruciating pain whenever she eats certain foods (which she describes as feeling “fire spears”).  She began cutting out foods containing gluten and dairy. Then she would still feel pain eating any fruits or vegetables, so those were cut out too. Finally she started a low histamine diet but could still not eat many of the foods that were considered low histamine.

Her diet is now comprised solely of ground beef, almonds, oatmeal, and raw sugar. These are the only foods that don’t cause her these fire spears, but it is gravely concerning as I know she is not eating enough calories in general. She has lost 10-15 lbs and is now struggling to keep her weight up.

With the excruciating pain, she’ll experience large, painful acne-like bumps on her face and swollen glands in her throat when she eats outside of those foods. I’ll also add that she has had issues with her face breaking out like this for a long time, and was on an antibiotic for over 10 years.

She has tried certain enzymes and medications to help but cannot stay on them long enough for them to potentially be effective as she reacts with the described symptoms as well as a rapid heartbeat that causes her a fear of a heart attack.

My family, as well as my mom herself, can see her deteriorating mentally in major ways, and physically declining more rapidly than before.

So I guess my questions - I know what the WBC and Hemoglobin counts are - WBC is amount of white blood cells, which can indicate an illness or infection if elevated. Hemoglobin is my red blood cell count, which identifies the number of red blood cells, which shows the amount of cells currently transporting oxygen/CO2 through my body - low means anemia, which is associated with low iron. Do I have those two right?

I also understand the cholesterol values, I'm just not sure how high/low they have to be before they become an issue?

For the rest, I don't know what the acronyms mean, and when I click, ""More info"" it just takes me to the info on the CBC.

Just curious what it all means.

Thanks!","Essentially, you have a microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin, small red blood cells). The most common cause of this in a young woman is iron deficiency from blood loss during periods. Yours isn't severe at all, and would be best helped by taking an iron supplement. The MCH/MCHC/RDW are all related to that.

AST can't really be ""low"" - that's not concerning. Your cholesterol isn't ideal, but again not seriously concerning.","Just got my yearly physical blood test results back, and my CBC had some non-standard results. Should I be concerned?

|LDL Cholesterol|(H)|110 mg/dL (calc)|(No range provided).|

So I guess my questions - I know what the WBC and Hemoglobin counts are - WBC is amount of white blood cells, which can indicate an illness or infection if elevated. Hemoglobin is my red blood cell count, which identifies the number of red blood cells, which shows the amount of cells currently transporting oxygen/CO2 through my body - low means anemia, which is associated with low iron. Do I have those two right?

I also understand the cholesterol values, I'm just not sure how high/low they have to be before they become an issue?

For the rest, I don't know what the acronyms mean, and when I click, ""More info"" it just takes me to the info on the CBC.

Just curious what it all means.

Thanks!","Answer: It appears that you have an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, and low hemoglobin, which suggests anemia. Your low hemoglobin may be related to low iron levels. You also have high non-HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, which are associated with an increased risk of heart disease. The other values you mentioned (MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, Calcium, AST, and HDL Cholesterol) are within the normal range or near the lower limit of normal, but may still be worth discussing with your PCP.

I have been experiencing mild speech issues for many years now and I don’t know if this is dysphasia or something else. I am being treated for dissociative identity disorder not other specified and when this plays up my speech is worse. 

My symptoms are: 
- I struggle to tell a story without getting exhausted or confused by what I’m saying. The stories can be as simple as what I did this evening
- sometimes I pronounce words wrong and seem to have no control over it
- sometimes I appear to have an absence of grammar or correct word inflection 
- I often want to say something but I have a mental block and the words don’t come out 

These symptoms may not necessarily seem extreme and I am able to function on a daily basis but I experience extreme emotional pain when I struggle to tell my partner or family a simple story. This week I felt suicidal because of the problem. It causes me a lot of shame, especially in my relationships because I feel like I have nothing to say or I cannot communicate with ease.","Hi!

47829,Fulminant MS diagnosis,"Hi, I'm 39F, 140lbs, 5'4"", rarely drink, rarely smoke pot. 

I just got out of the hospital, a 17 day stay where I received this diagnosis. I don't have any of the five MRI reports or other clinical information,  only what I am understanding which probably isn't helpful, idk. 

I went in on 5/23 to the ER with numbness in my face, hands, legs and feet, unable to balance, unable to see  due to severe double vision, insane tinnitus, and just unable to function. They did several MRI's, all the blood tests and then more blood tests. They placed me on high dose steroids for five days with not much improvement,  and decided to keep me longer to do plasma exchange, which I responded well to. The sensation in my hands is back to normal,  and so were my feet although they're numb again just not as bad. The tinnitus never improved and is now accompanied with auditory hallucinations and can get very severely loud. Balance is better bit not good.

Anyway the reason I'm writing this is because I'm hoping someone who can give it to me straight because I think my doctors aren't giving me the whole picture. Everything I read ( I know I know) says I have like 2 years to live tops. Could be dead in a week. The doctor in the hospital said that he is cautiously optimistic because I'm responding or rather I did respond well to the plasma Exchange therapy. I don't really say anything much beyond that when I asked her prognosis I just say cautiously optimistic. I have a family so I feel like I need more information than that.

Are there any doctors here with experience with this type of MS? Like seriously what are my odds that's my question and I know you can't 100% answer that and that's fine I just feel like I know nothing and I could be dead in two weeks and have nothing planned out for my family. My husband had a stroke in 2019 and is very disabled from that so I would have to have family members in mind that would take my job over and help also take care of my husband.

Sorry it got rambly I'm using speech to text.

As for your bigger question of ""is my life expectancy 2 years"" -- google can be cruel.

22598,Worried about new symptoms pointing towards Lymphoma,"24 / M / 144 lbs / 5’9” / Filipino-American

Concerns for me started around Dec. 4, 2018 and that’s when I started experiencing symptoms I’d never had before:

* Constant night sweats that would wake me up once or twice a night
* Weight loss
* Generalized itchiness
* Intermittent stomach pains with loose stools
* Intermittent chest tightness

I’d been having some chest tightness from time to time over the past few months and I always put it off as health anxiety because it comes and goes and it doesn’t trigger from exercise. 

But the concerning part for me are the constant night sweats and weight loss. I had dropped from roughly 150 lbs down to 142 lbs over the course of two weeks. I’ve been actively monitoring my caloric intake and eating MORE than I typically would to make sure it doesn’t drop any lower. Before all of this, I would eat around 1000-1500 cal/day and maintain weight. Now, I’m eating ~2000 cal/day and just got back up to 144 lbs.

I’ve visited my PCP several times and had blood work done along with a CT scan done on my abdomen. Blood work all checked out within normal levels and CT scan showed nothing other than gas and possibly early appendicitis (no pain when doing heel test, jumping, or during the release when pressing down though).

There has only been ONE night where I haven’t woken up sweating in the past 2-3 weeks and considering I otherwise feel okay, this is concerning for me. I pushed for a biopsy but my PCP says that none of lymph nodes feel enlarged and it could just be a really bad bacterial or viral infection (I’ll admit, I didn’t get my flu shot this year...)

Should I push further? Do these symptoms seem like something I should be concerned about?","CT abdomen with contrast or without? If was with contrast and says there's nothing to biopsy, then there's nothing to biopsy.

42754,Typical for surgeon/docs not to look at file until time of appointment?,"I posted here about the open heart surgery I was due to have tomorrow. About eight weeks ago, doc put a camera through my wrist to look at my heart and, if needed, shoot shunts into my heart for a quick fix (please excuse my ignorance if I am using the wrong terms.)  No dice on the shunts, i was told I would have to be opened up and a part of one the heart valves has a thickness on one of the walls, a myectomy as I have Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

My cardiologist put me in touch with a heart surgeon and through his office, scheduled the surgery to follow a meeting with him I had today. I live three hours away from the hospital so I imagine that the eight weeks between my last procedure and the one tomorrow was the only time I could see meet him, be admitted and then have my surgery tomorrow.

I got to my appointment today and the doc shows up and said he will just be a couple of minutes as he needs to talk with my cardiologist to talk about my file or pictures of my heart or something. He comes back 10 minuets later and says that he thinks he will need to do a different procedure because he is not sure removing just one part of the valve is going to do the trick because more of the Wall has hardened...again, I apologize for my ignorance (and rambling.)

This is the fifth time at this hospital that I walk in and the doctor asks me “so what’s going on,” and “is there a history of heart disease in your family.” My question is, is it normal/regular for a doctors to not even open a file prior to meeting with a patient? 

It’s getting old, I am tired of answering the same questions over and over and I have been gearing up for a very invasive surgery for the past two months only to be told the day before, nah. I am trying to be patient but I don’t know how much more I can take.

49501,Question about my doctor's behavior on my last visit,"I'm a 72 year old female with a history of ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia, mild asthma as well as PTSD, anxiety/depression.

I don't know who to talk to about this, so I'm hoping a doctor here can help me.

My primary doctor left town with no notice and no referral, so I had to find a new doctor. One was recommended to me by my pulmonologist. He seemed very nice the times I'd seen him, twice in person and twice on video chat. But this last video appointment makes me concerned that I need to find a new doctor.

I have mild PTSD from an abusive marriage and abusive work situation. I was finally able to escape from both but have lasting effects. I see a psychiatrist (who I like a lot) through Teledoc who put me on 15mg of Lexapro. I also take 0.5mg of Ativan/Lorazepam at bedtime to quiet racing thoughts and abusive images. I have been on the 0.5 Ativan for about four years. Nothing else works at night. (If I forget to take it I can't sleep due to the persistent bad thoughts and memories.) I tried Trazodone but it gives me the kind of nightmares that make you stay up the rest of the night. 

Teledoc does not allow their doctors to prescribe Schedule IV meds. I had a wellness appointment with my new internist and wanted to discuss my Ativan to make sure he could prescribe it. (I've been getting it through my departed doctor's PA.) Well, when I brought it up he went ballistic. He was so loud my sister could hear him in the next room. He went on and on about horrible side effects in seniors (I'm 72) and how it can make you fall and affect your memory. 

I tried to reason with him and explain why I take it and why my psychiatrist could not prescribe it but he just talked over me. I had an anxiety attack and couldn't remember the dose or the name Trazodone, so I'm sure he thinks I'm senile now. He stated that he needs a note from my psychiatrist explaining why I take it and then added that I would have to come in and leave a urine sample every month in order to get my prescription refilled. When I said I'd never had to do this, he told me that I'd be doing it for him. 

I had a bad anxiety attack after he hung up and it resulted in my ankylosing spondylitis kicking into high gear and giving me a very painful and stiff few days. I was able to contact my psychiatrist who told me that he'd put a note in recommending 37 Ativan 0.5mg a month so that I would have enough for bedtime and to take one during the day if I had an anxiety attack. He stated that the doctor was overreacting and that it's a small dose that works for me. He told me to ""take a picture"" of his note and give it to the doctor. He also told me I need someone more empathetic. 

So now I'm stuck in an ongoing low-grade anxiety attack, worried about trying to find another doctor when this one took me nearly a year. I'm not sure if he was being a good doctor and looking out for me, even though he didn't really listen when I was trying to tell him about my PTSD. Was he being overbearing because I know he could tell how upset I was getting. I felt like I was being accused of drug seeking instead of someone worried that they would not be able to get a medication that helps them. It's only 0.5mg, which is not considered too high a dose by my psychiatrist.","Newly minted doctor here, so I don't have a whole lot of cred, but to start, if a doctor makes you uncomfortable or reacts in a way you deem inappropriate, I'd say get a new doctor. Maybe give him a 2nd try in case he was having a stressful day, but low threshold to switch. 


Regarding the medication, it's on the Beers criteria list of medications where the benefits don't outweigh the risks on a population scale. Pretty strong evidence that it increases risk of falls, fractures, etc., which is why he is against prescribing it. So medically, he's not really wrong, he just went about it in the wrong way. Now what's the reason reason why your psychiatrist can't prescribe it for you? It's a med that's 100% in his/her wheelhouse anyway and should be more comfortable prescribing it.","Question about my doctor's behavior on my last visit

14802,Partner [33M] suddenly experiencing muscle weakness on left side of face. We suspect Bell's palsy. What should we do?,"My partner \[33M\] started experiencing partial muscle weakness on the left side of his face last night while driving. He could still move the left side of his face, but his muscles were noticeably weaker (his eyelid was drooping slightly, his smile was crooked, and the left side of his face just looked a bit slack overall). The left side of his face also looked slightly swollen/puffy, but I suspect this was from him rubbing it while trying to figure out what was going on. As far as we can tell, there was nothing about his activities yesterday that would explain the sudden weakness. He also noted that his left ear had been bothering him; he wondered if he might have inflammation that is putting pressure on a nerve. 

Since he did not have any other symptoms that would suggest a stroke (slurred speech, paralysis, etc.), he assumed it might be Bell's palsy and decided to sleep on it rather than going to the ER. He is uninsured and is hoping to avoid unnecessary medical costs (we are in the US). This morning, he said that he felt like the muscle weakness was marginally worse, as he felt like he had less control over the left side of his face, though it is not completely paralyzed. We're wondering what the best course of action would be. My partner is a white male, approximately 5'11"" and 200lbs. His existing medical conditions include severe asthma, OCD, ADHD, and anxiety, all of which he takes medications for (albuterol inhaler, Adderall, BuSpar). He drinks semi-regularly (maybe 3-4 beverages a week) and does not smoke or use any recreational drugs.

We are concerned about the costs associated with going to the ER, as well as the risks of COVID-19, since my partner is in an at-risk population due to his asthma -- we have been following strict social distancing measures as a result.

It can sometimes be difficult to tell, though. One of the classic differences between Bell's palsy and a stroke is the forehead muscles. If he cannot move or wrinkle his forehead and brow muscles at all, this would be more consistent with a peripheral nerve problem such as Bell's palsy. If he can wrinkle or move his forehead and brow muscles, this would be more concerning for a central nerve problem such as a stroke or brain lesion.

You are obviously the only one who can decide the right course of action here.

We suspect Bell's palsy. What should we do?

My partner \[33M\] started experiencing partial muscle weakness on the left side of his face last night while driving. He could still move the left side of his face, but his muscles were noticeably weaker (his eyelid was drooping slightly, his smile was crooked, and the left side of his face just looked a bit slack overall). The left side of his face also looked slightly swollen/puffy, but I suspect this was from him rubbing it while trying to figure out what was going on. As far as we can tell, there was nothing about his activities yesterday that would explain the sudden weakness. He also noted that his left ear had been bothering him; he wondered if he might have inflammation that is putting pressure on a nerve. 

Since he did not have any other symptoms that would suggest a stroke (slurred speech, paralysis, etc.), he assumed it might be Bell's palsy and decided to sleep on it rather than going to the ER. He is uninsured and is hoping to avoid unnecessary medical costs (we are in the US). This morning, he said that he felt like the muscle weakness was marginally worse, as he felt like he had less control over the left side of his face, though it is not completely paralyzed. We're wondering what the best course of action would be. My partner is a white male, approximately 5'11"" and 200lbs.

Hi All, 

I don't normally do social media or any online posts but I'm desperate at this stage. . I've been suffering from some unknown autoimmune or neurological issue since approx September last year and I've since spent the majority of my savings on private tests and appointments which have so far proved fruitless. I'm fast running out of savings. I've been unwell for almost a year now and can't face another in the same condition. It's completely taken over and destroyed my life. The public system here (Republic of Ireland) has been truly awful, dealing with them has been as bad as any physical problem I have. I've tried to get help in Belfast and have been let down there too. I've waited 8 months for appointments from apathetic,uninterested doctors who just book me in again in another 3-4 months, it's a constant merry go round of waiting and let downs that I can't stay on much longer. If I were to change consultants it's a 12 month wait to see someone different, even privately. I really need help soon. Any advice from those who know where to find it would be greatly appreciated.   
For anyone interested these have been my symptoms: 

* **Facial nerve contraction-** leading to dropped right eye, can also sometimes affect cheek/ mouth causing it to drop or raise like a snarl. Pressure in face/head. Slight issue in left too but mainly right. 
* **Fatigue-** can be low-grade and constant or sudden, sharp fatigue which comes without warning and can leave me unable to move. I call it ""powering down"" for lack of a better term. 
* **Dizziness-** Unsteady on my feet, often needing to lean against something to stay up. 
* **Slurred speech-** My speech can get slow and difficult, it can be as if I'm doing a ""My Left Foot"" audition. 
* **Brain fog-** Find it hard to concentrate, I often forget what I'm saying mid-sentence and forget words for basic things.
* **Involuntary movements/sounds(newest symptom)-** head/neck can dart/tense to the side without intention. I feel a tightness in my muscles when this happens. I can also laugh, shout, wail and make a variety of sounds randomly and without provocation. Tourettes-like at times.  

I've had brain MRIs and MRAs to rule out tumors and aneurysms, as well as an EMG to rule out Myasthenia Gravis. I've been told I don't have MS based on brain MRIs but I'm aware this is not a definitive way of ruling it out, I've begged for lumbar punctures to check for this and been refused each time for some reason. I've been prescribed Clonazepam(Benzos) and given botox injections for my involuntary movements. These are only to alleviate some symptoms as opposed to treating the root problem, which is what I'm desperate to find.  I thought if there's a 1/100 chance posting helps speed up a diagnosis then it's probably worth it.

6888,Worried about my heart,"Ok so I’m probably being a bit over dramatic but I am really worried about my heart rate and that’s probably not doing me much good either.

I have an appointment to have an ecg at the doctors next week, but that just tests your resting heart rate and I’m more concerned about my rate when standing and moving about.

So I’m 39 female and 140lbs. my Apple Watch has my resting heart rate at 95, but when I’m simply standing up doing the washing up or something it goes up to 130-140 sometimes higher. I got worried last week when I did a workout video and my heart rate went over 200. What worries me also is I’m fairly active, I walk to work and work as a cleaner but the watch always tells me my fitness is bad, heart rate variability is 20 and v02 max is 25.5. I don’t have a clue what this all means but it seems to be telling me I’m unhealthy but I don’t know why. 

I lost a lot of weight last year and I thought that would help with my heart rate but it hasn’t. 

Can anyone tell me that I don’t need to worry and that my ranges seem ok?",Do you have any symptoms when it's telling you the heart rate is that high?  And can you take your pulse the old fashioned way (use your 2 fingers on your other wrist) to see if it agrees with your apple watch?,"Worried about my heart

4264,Mom hasn't gone to the Doctor in 30+ years.,"My mom just turned 60, and hasn't been to the doctor in over 30 years. She's scared to go alone, and also very stubborn about taking advice from her kids (we all keep telling her she needs to).

I live across the country from her, but want to take some vacation time to visit AND attend Doctors appointments with her while I am there. My question is, what should we schedule for a 60 year old women who has had no Healthcare in 30+ years? A physical? A well women exam? What else is needed for someone her age? Any advice in general on what to expect and put her at ease?

She has health insurance, just never uses it. Thanks everyone.","If she hasn’t been to a doctor in over 30 years, she needs multiple appointments to get caught up. 

Does she have a doctor now? If not, the first appointment should ideally be a “meet and greet” so she can get to know her doc and the doc can get all her background info: past surgeries, family history, any meds she takes, that sort of thing. Probably a blood pressure check and she’ll probably be asked to get some lab work done for basic screening tests (diabetes check, cholesterol). This appointment has a LOT to it (even if she does already know the doctor, they have 30 years to catch up on!), and this visit is best done without going over any active health issues to get through all the necessary stuff. The best time to do this is when she’s healthy and has nothing going on, so it sounds like now might be a great time to do this.

Then she should book appointment #2. That will probably be another blood pressure check and to go over the lab work results, or else a well woman exam, but not both. To do either of those things properly they each need their own appointment, your mom and doc can decide on visit #1 which one is best. 

If she has any active health issues too (knee pain, back pain, etc), they really do need their own appointment so they don’t get shortchanged. If there is something urgent your mom is worried about, which is why sometimes people are scared to go, it’s still going to take 2 appointments at least to get it sorted out because we often need bloodwork or tests and to see you back before we know what’s up. 

Hopefully that helps! Tell your mom not to be nervous, we love to see people who haven’t seen us before or not in a long time. A lot of doctors are not letting visitors accompany patients to appointments right now because of covid, so make sure you ask their office before you take time off and travel - you can always FaceTime into the appointment or join on speakerphone.","Mom hasn't gone to the Doctor in 30+ years.

Should I get a rabies shot? Ive never heard of a squirell having rabies. i know rabies has to be transmitted by saliva or brain matter, and the likelyhood of a squirell surviving an encounter with a rabid animal is very low. I would go to the hospital.. but no insurance until january.

&#x200B;

Hi, so last night I had 5 shots of vodka from about 9:00 to 10:30.

Today I woke up and had a throbbing headache so I decided to take two excedrin (500mg acetominphen, 500mg aspirin, 130mg caffeine total) at about 10:45 am, so about 12 hours after drinking. Now it's 1:25 pm and for the past two hours I have been feeling slightly nauseous. I'm worried that I have stomach bleeding and have no idea how serious that is. I haven't vomited yet but have felt like I almost did at a few points in the past few hours. I'm kind of freaking out which probably doesn't help the nausea.

&#x200B;

How much damage did I do to my stomach with 500mg aspirin and could this be dangerous? I know the acetaminphen is bad too but just for your liver so that would be a separate problem and I have read that it's only bad for your liver if you do this consistently.

&#x200B;

I'm mainly just worried about my stomach now, also I ate 4 scrambled eggs before taking the excedrin.","Sounds more like alcohol gastritis. Ulcers develop over time.

I'm currently not sexually active, I do shave every other week, but my labia majora is not as smooth as I hope it would be (or at least expect). I got these white bumps that does not itch or hurt. I remember always having them but really paid no mind in my late teens. My OB checked them and said there is nothing to worry about since they don't burn, itch, or hurt. She squeezed one of them and white stuff came out, like a white head. She said it's a sebaceous gland thing coz oil and moisture and I should stop shaving or removing hair. 

Just hoping to find people who can relate coz it bother me still...I tend to overthink. Anyone else had/have these?","Answer: The white bumps on the labia majora are likely to be sebaceous glands, which are normal and common in this area, especially in women of East Asian descent.

I have some unexplained LLQ pain. I am a 40F, white, 128lbs, 5'8"", symptoms started vaguely roughly 1.5 years ago, but continue to worsen. I have EDS-H, mild scoliosis, history of pectus excavatum, sleep apnea, neck issues, perineural cysts, and several joint operations - FAI (left), and frozen shoulder.  


First instance of pain took me to the ER. It felt troubling like a past bowel obstruction, but I had a CT and was sent home. I was constipated, and the pain was almost muscular - like the muscles you'd engage to poop on your abdomen. I also had waves of intestinal cramps akin to a bowel obstruction.  


Then came worsening periods. Then a Mirena IUD.  The IUD helped reduce bleeding to pretty much just spotting, but I starting getting these crazy 15s insane radiating pain in my lower left pelvic area, that would radiate to the center front of my thigh, and low back along the pelvis edge. Those seemed to happen at the time of a period.   


Im getting less of the intense ones, more of the LLQ diffuse achey all the time with occasional radiation to thigh/low back.  


I oddly have two friends with nutcracker syndrome and may thurner - both said it reminded them of a clot or pelvic congestion syndrome. I am so very tired of asking doctors for help and being dismissed that I can't bring myself to ask again. Thus I'm wondering if my images at all are indicative of May Thurner. It measures 4mm across at it's narrowest point in the image.  


I have no DVT history, but I do have a history of 6 Pulmonary emboli when I had a lot medically going on, including recent abdominal surgery, and substantial bed rest.   


These MRIs predate the time of the pain starting. They also rule out anything majorly wrong. I also had the IUD checked with a transvaginal US in office and that was fine.  

I assume, but don't know, that you cannot last 6+ months with pain due to a clot, so the chances seem low that May Thurner is an issue. Thoughts?","Hi, I'm a radiologist.

The IUD helped reduce bleeding to pretty much just spotting, but I starting getting these crazy 15s insane radiating pain in my lower left pelvic area, that would radiate to the center front of my thigh, and low back along the pelvis edge. Those seemed to happen at the time of a period.   


Im getting less of the intense ones, more of the LLQ diffuse achey all the time with occasional radiation to thigh/low back.  


I oddly have two friends with nutcracker syndrome and may thurner - both said it reminded them of a clot or pelvic congestion syndrome. I am so very tired of asking doctors for help and being dismissed that I can't bring myself to ask again. Thus I'm wondering if my images at all are indicative of May Thurner. It measures 4mm across at it's narrowest point in the image.  


I have no DVT history, but I do have a history of 6 Pulmonary emboli when I had a lot medically going on, including recent abdominal surgery, and substantial bed rest.   


These MRIs predate the time of the pain starting. They also rule out anything majorly wrong. I also had the IUD checked with a transvaginal US in office and that was fine.  

I assume, but don't know, that you cannot last 6+ months with pain due to a clot, so the chances seem low that May Thurner is an issue. Thoughts?","Answer: The images show a 4mm compression of the left common iliac vein, which could be indicative of May-Thurner syndrome, but the clinical correlation is not definitive without further investigation.

3467,I’ve never been able to insert anything in my vagina without extreme pain,"Mandatory info:

• Age: 20
• Sex: Female
• Height: 5 ft
• Weight: 90 lbs
• Race: Caucasian
• Location on body: Vagina
• Duration of complaint: I’ve known about the issue since I hit puberty
• No diagnosed medical issues
• No smoking/drugs/alcohol
• No medication

So my problem is exactly what the title says. This is a very uncomfortable/weird thing for me to talk about, but I’ll do my best to be as detailed as possible.

Basically I’ve never been able to insert anything into my vagina without extreme pain. The most I’ve been able to do is insert an object the size of my pinky finger a couple inches inside it, but that’s it. I’ve never been able to insert anything bigger, and I’ve never been able to go more than a couple inches in without hitting what feels like a road block where I physically can’t push it in any further.  The “road block” itself doesn’t hurt, but I’m afraid if I force it any further, I will hurt myself.

During every attempt I’ve made to insert anything inside, I was sufficiently aroused and lubed up, so I know that’s not the problem.

Every person I’ve talked to about this said that this is normal and after I lose my virginity, I won’t have this problem anymore. But I can’t shake the feeling that this isn’t normal, and I feel like my concerns aren’t being taken seriously. I have no idea how I’m gonna be able to lose my virginity if I can’t even insert my own finger. I’d like to go to a gynecologist, but financially that’s just not possible.

So is this a problem that can be fixed? Or is this something that’s actually normal, and I just have to suck it up and deal with the pain?
","So I would say I'm suspicious of two things.

1) vaginismus which is where the vaginal muscles are very contracted. Pelvic floor physical therapy can help with this. It is uncomfortable at first, but worth it. Lots of women have good success so don't be too scared of it even though it sounds daunting.

2) Vaginal anomaly. You could have something called a vaginal septum or a partially imperforate hymen. This would mean you have vaginal tissues that are physically restricting or stopping anything from going in because they are blocking the way.

Either way, definitely see an obgyn as they can tell you definitively pretty easily.
