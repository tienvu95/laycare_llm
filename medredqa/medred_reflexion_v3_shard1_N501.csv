I am also a physician but disagree with /u/Edronline: even if the procedure was considered a success and the op note only reports excision of a benign cyst, this could have reduced the amount of viable breast bud (especially in a adolescent male). Even minimally invasive procs in the pre-female-pubescent subareolar breast can lead to more pronounced asymmetry later in life. For this reason, we are reluctant to do biopsies in female children (especially since nearly all such biopsies are benign before puberty starts to stimulate the bud). 

But even if the male breast has never been touched with a scalpel, the buds are often asymmetric. We see this in older men with gynecomastia all the time. Normal variant. 

Now if the old op note says that a part of the bud was excised, then you have the likely answer. If no mention of other tissue removed, then you don’t know. This could just be asymmetric exogenous hormone effect due to the way you formed. Or it could be from your surgery.

b. I will consider the potential",0.8,0.8,"I'm in Canada, but most child protection laws are similar around the world. If a doc from Ireland comments, their advice may be more relevant for you; although hopefully I can help.

As you mentioned, you're an adult now. Under the law, adults are able to determine for themselves what the right course of action is. Mandatory reporting exists for children because they are powerless in a situation, and at times cannot speak for themselves. But as an adult now, you would fall outside the mandatory reporting laws and outside the child protection system. Your doctor must keep your confidentiality above all else, and cannot go report to the police or child protection on your behalf without your permission in cases of past trauma.

And it sounds like this situation was in the past, so there would be no grounds for your doctor to break confidentiality. Even if it was ongoing, as an adult, it's your choice what to do about the situation. As an example, there are lots of adults who experience domestic violence at home. And while we worry about our patients and their safety, that's their choice and we can't override confidentiality to talk to the police. That's wrong for a number of reasons. So we support them and try to mitigate risk in the interim.

All this to say, you should 100% be able to bring up these concerns with your doctor. You can start the conversation and simply say, ""What is your policy on confidentiality and mandatory reporting?"" (adding, if you like, ""I have some trauma in my past that is hard to talk about"" or something to that effect if you feel safe to do so). Ideally this way, your doc can go over local rules and then you can disclose what you choose, in a timeline you choose, and in the detail you choose. You're in control this way.

I think you're past the point that child protection would have to be involved, and past the point of mandatory reporting for previously experienced trauma. You should never, ever, have to speak your assaulter's name if you do not want to. This is your story, your life - not theirs.

So if you feel safe to do so, definitely make an appointment with your doctor to go over this stuff. Like most humans, not all docs are trauma-informed, so if you do find that talking to this doctor isn't the right person to talk about this with, ask for a referral to a specialist who has experience with adverse childhood experiences / child trauma.

We know alcohol causes birth defects, we also know that sometimes women who drink a little (think a glass of wine or a sip of champagne) before they know they are pregnant have OK outcomes- we don’t know what the limit is, if there is a limit (ie, is every fetus different?) etc. so we say no drinking, because the risk (FAS) is definitely there no matter what stage or how much you drink. It is not safe to drink alcohol while pregnant because we don’t know if there is a safe amount or what that safe amount is and it’s unethical to experiment. 

As for LSD... in rats it can cause miscarriage, and it has been shown to reduce blood flow in the placenta. It also sticks around in the placenta, which is a risk for mom, because placentas can and sometimes are tested for illegal substances after birth, which can be used to report mom to CPS. There are limited old studies showing eye damage to the fetus when mom takes LSD. It also has a statistically significant chance of causing chromosome damage to the fetus, which is a grab bag of effects. There is also a chance it does nothing. Some moms have done LSD before they knew or while they were pregnant and had normal babies. 

Ultimately, like alcohol, we know it can cause problems, but there isn’t a way to know where the line can be drawn. If you were sitting in my clinic, I’d say if you took LSD before you knew, wait to panic. If you’re considering taking it now, I’d advise you not to, since the effects in rats can be bad and again... we don’t know the line in the sand. So better safe than sorry.

My reasoning was incomplete because I didn't fully consider the patient's symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain, which could be related to a variety of conditions, including adenomyosis, endometriosis, or a pelvic mass. I also didn't fully explore the possibility that the hard, big thing in the patient's vagina could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a vaginal or cervical abnormality.

Upon further reflection, I realize that the patient's primary concern should be their own health and well-being, rather than the safety of other patients. While it is understandable that the patient wants to take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, their doctor is likely to take these concerns into account and provide guidance on how to proceed.

The patient is considering pulling their teeth back into their original position before the wisdom teeth came out.

Thought 3: The patient's history of impacted wisdom teeth and subsequent facial pains, as well as the development of TMJ symptoms after the eruption of the wisdom teeth, suggests that the impacted teeth may be a contributing factor to their TMJ issues.

Thought 5: The patient's history of smoking weed to cope with pain and anxiety suggests",,,"I’m a dentist and I would advise going to a dental school (or some sort of facility with dental research, but generally dental schools are your best bet) and seeing an orofacial pain/TMD specialist. TMD stands for temporomandibular disorder, the term for TMJ disorders. There are not that many out there, and it is not a recognized dental specialty, but I know of one at a dental school where the dentist solely focuses on people with horrible pain related to the TMJ and face and works with a physical therapist to help alleviate the issues. The one I’m familiar with prescribes a lot of muscle relaxants and uses massage and home therapy. 

I don’t think TMD can always be treated by orthotic devices or braces, either. It depends on the case, but I would be worried about there being any actual degradation within the TMJs on either side. I assume you’ve had some sort of panoramic radiograph or even hopefully a cone beam CT scan to monitor your joints!

The popping in the TMJ is not always an issue in and of itself, but it has to do with the joint’s rotation and glide motion having some interference to get back to the resting position.

The way that I learned it, the spaces you have between your top and bottom teeth really COULD be a sign that there is degradation of your joint. If you think about it, if the hinge that connects your maxilla (top) and mandible changes, then your teeth are unable to come together the same way. Based on your symptoms, it sounds like the joint problem is causing the tooth problem, and moving the teeth around (braces) is not going to address the fact that the joint is breaking down. It is more likely that than the braces causing the posterior space, but I could be wrong. It sounds like a lot of different treatments have been attempted so far. 

I really hope you’re able to find an orofacial pain/TMD specialist!!! I think you really need someone who is familiar with joint degradation to help you out more fully, and this is a case that I personally as a general dentist would not be able to treat alone.

Edit: Also, going to a sleep specialist and having a sleep study done is not a bad idea either! Sleep apnea could definitely be contributing to the migraines and irritability, but I am very suspicious of actual TMJ degradation based on the inability to eat and just the amount of pain you’re experiencing.",False,False,4,3,"1.

The idea of the test is to see how your glucose levels change over a 2 hour period

I work in the microbiology lab. I tell your doctors what the bacteria (or other) we find so that they can treat more effectively. 

I don’t know a lot about the clinical side, but I can tell you that normally respiratory samples we get are usually sputum or a lavage (they “wash” the lung and send us the fluid that is washed out). Normally these samples are sufficient to diagnose a cause of pneumonia. 

The problem is that bacteria are very good at hiding. If they are not on the surfaces of the lung or if they form a barrier to protect themselves (biofilm, abscess), then it may be much harder to recover the bacteria on a lavage. In those cases it may be necessary also to take a piece of the lung itself so we can grind the tissue and try to release the bacteria to grow it so we can get some answers. 

Of course, they could be doing the surgery to remove the infection before it can spread. There are also things other than bacteria that can cause pneumonia that will not appear on a culture unless specifically requested (mold, mycobacterium such as tuberculosis, viruses).

My answer was correct, but I may have been too narrow in my consideration of potential causes for the burning sensation.

Although medical therapies may improve deep dyspareunia in women with endometriosis, laparoscopic excision of deep endometriotic lesions has been demonstrated to improve not only deep dyspareunia but also the quality of sex life.

Briefly explain why your reasoning or answer may have been wrong or incomplete.
My reasoning was correct in identifying the need for further evaluation and potential complications, but my answer was incomplete because I didn't consider the possibility that the patient's symptoms may be due to a viral infection, which would not respond to antibiotics. I also didn't consider the potential for a misdiagnosis or a secondary bacterial infection. Additionally, I didn't provide a clear plan for the next steps in management, which would be essential for a patient who has not improved after two days of antibiotic treatment.

Looks like the beginning of dry gangrene to me. Most common cause is peripheral artery disease, where the arteries supplying your legs / feet / toes get clogged up so not enough blood gets to the extremities. The tissues downstream essentially just wither away from lack of oxygen.

The usual progression for this kind of dry gangrene would be autoamputation, where the affected tissue (in this case, his third toe) would eventually, quite literally, fall off painlessly.

I would expect his scan was some kind of CT angiogram to reveal where the blockage is.

My answer was correct in identifying the need for prompt treatment, but it may have been incomplete in considering the patient's specific circumstances, such as his age, frailty, and cognitive impairment.

My reasoning and answer may have been wrong or incomplete because I did not consider the patient's concerns and anxiety thoroughly enough.
