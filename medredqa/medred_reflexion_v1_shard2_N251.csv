My reasoning was correct in that the patient's vasovagal syndrome is not typically considered a high-risk condition for COVID-19. However, I may have been too hasty in concluding that the patient is not in a high-risk group for COVID-19. I did not consider the potential impact of the patient's anxiety on their immune system, which could increase their risk of complications from COVID-19.

For this reason, we are reluctant to do biopsies in female children (especially since nearly all such biopsies are benign before puberty starts to stimulate the bud).

25331,"The doctor is likely to report the situation to CPS, but the patient may not have to reveal the name of the perpetrator. The patient's age at the time of the abuse and the fact that she is now an adult may be taken into account when determining the course of action.","The doctor may not be required to report the situation again, but it is best to err on the side of caution and report it to CPS. The patient's current adult status and her decision to come forward to report the abuse may not necessarily exempt her from the reporting requirements. The doctor's duty to report suspected child abuse is not solely dependent on the patient's age at the time of the abuse, but also on the fact that the patient is now an adult and has come forward to report the abuse. However, the doctor's reporting requirements may be influenced by the patient's current adult status and her decision to come forward to report the abuse.","I'm in Canada, but most child protection laws are similar around the world. If a doc from Ireland comments, their advice may be more relevant for you; although hopefully I can help.

As you mentioned, you're an adult now. Under the law, adults are able to determine for themselves what the right course of action is. Mandatory reporting exists for children because they are powerless in a situation, and at times cannot speak for themselves. But as an adult now, you would fall outside the mandatory reporting laws and outside the child protection system. Your doctor must keep your confidentiality above all else, and cannot go report to the police or child protection on your behalf without your permission in cases of past trauma.

And it sounds like this situation was in the past, so there would be no grounds for your doctor to break confidentiality. Even if it was ongoing, as an adult, it's your choice what to do about the situation. As an example, there are lots of adults who experience domestic violence at home. And while we worry about our patients and their safety, that's their choice and we can't override confidentiality to talk to the police. That's wrong for a number of reasons. So we support them and try to mitigate risk in the interim.

All this to say, you should 100% be able to bring up these concerns with your doctor. You can start the conversation and simply say, ""What is your policy on confidentiality and mandatory reporting?"" (adding, if you like, ""I have some trauma in my past that is hard to talk about"" or something to that effect if you feel safe to do so). Ideally this way, your doc can go over local rules and then you can disclose what you choose, in a timeline you choose, and in the detail you choose. You're in control this way.

I think you're past the point that child protection would have to be involved, and past the point of mandatory reporting for previously experienced trauma. You should never, ever, have to speak your assaulter's name if you do not want to. This is your story, your life - not theirs.

So if you feel safe to do so, definitely make an appointment with your doctor to go over this stuff. Like most humans, not all docs are trauma-informed, so if you do find that talking to this doctor isn't the right person to talk about this with, ask for a referral to a specialist who has experience with adverse childhood experiences / child trauma. If you aren't getting anywhere, some google sleuthing for doctor reviews may help you find the name of someone who could help, or sometimes different community groups have professionals they recommend.",False,False,0.8,,4,3,"1.

25331,It is not safe for the patient to consume LSD while pregnant. The patient should be advised against it due to the potential risks to the fetus.,"It is not safe to consume 400ug of LSD during the first trimester of pregnancy. The risks associated with LSD during pregnancy are not well understood, and it is best to err on the side of caution and avoid its use during this time.","So we don’t actually know if there is a safe level of alcohol for pregnant mothers to drink. We know alcohol causes birth defects, we also know that sometimes women who drink a little (think a glass of wine or a sip of champagne) before they know they are pregnant have OK outcomes- we don’t know what the limit is, if there is a limit (ie, is every fetus different?) etc. so we say no drinking, because the risk (FAS) is definitely there no matter what stage or how much you drink. It is not safe to drink alcohol while pregnant because we don’t know if there is a safe amount or what that safe amount is and it’s unethical to experiment. 

As for LSD... in rats it can cause miscarriage, and it has been shown to reduce blood flow in the placenta. It also sticks around in the placenta, which is a risk for mom, because placentas can and sometimes are tested for illegal substances after birth, which can be used to report mom to CPS. There are limited old studies showing eye damage to the fetus when mom takes LSD. It also has a statistically significant chance of causing chromosome damage to the fetus, which is a grab bag of effects. There is also a chance it does nothing. Some moms have done LSD before they knew or while they were pregnant and had normal babies. 

Ultimately, like alcohol, we know it can cause problems, but there isn’t a way to know where the line can be drawn. If you were sitting in my clinic, I’d say if you took LSD before you knew, wait to panic. If you’re considering taking it now, I’d advise you not to, since the effects in rats can be bad and again... we don’t know the line in the sand. So better safe than sorry. 

This is unfortunately the answer for a lot of things in pregnancy!

My reasoning was correct in that the patient's symptoms could be indicative of a different condition, but I may have been too focused on the symptoms and not enough on the patient's exposure history and the results of the HIV tests.

She is seeking a second opinion on whether this is standard procedure or not.","So when you phrase it they way you have it doesn't sound appropriate. However, there is a decent chance what happened is you were 1-3 ish centimeters dilated and your gyn was making sure the exam was accurate. I say this because for first time moms, it is not uncommon to have a longer cervix. The outside can be dilated while the inside can be still mostly closed or much narrower.

Sometimes, due to the anatomy, to *really* get an accurate check, we 'drag' down the cervix to get our finger alllll the way in to the tipy top. And by that I mean move your cervix down at most a centimeter. It's not really possible to do much more than that. It is definitely uncomfortable, and we only try to do it when it's super important - such as deciding what to do next during an induction.

If for example someone is 1 cm rather than 3, we will often do different things. So it's important to know. It definitely is uncomfortable though. Cervical exams are just the worst. 

I have always done my best to keep them as brief and gentle as possible, but a variety of factors can make that challenging.

I did not consider the possibility that the patient might have already ingested the poison through the cockroach, which could have led to a more detailed and accurate response. Additionally, I did not provide a clear plan for the patient to follow, such as waiting for further guidance from poison control before consuming food or water.

It would be impossible to know if this brief episode was a fib or not without having had you on the monitor. I will say, however, that while a fib can be intermittent or paroxysmal, it generally would last more than 10 seconds if you actually had it. So a brief episode of palpitations is less likely to be a fib. I wouldn't worry about it for now. If you do start noticing more frequent palpitations, the best thing would be to get a heart monitor for a couple of weeks to see if it picks up any a fib. And if you have an episode like this that lasts continuously more than a few minutes, or makes you feel very dizzy like you're about to faint, go to the hospital to see if they can capture what it is.",False,False,0.9,0.8,4,3,"1.
