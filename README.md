# laycare_llm (IDL 11785/ F25 - Project 21)
Our group collaborate mainly via colab and kaggle notebook. We update our code/data/results here to satisfy the project requirement.

* pubmed_reflexion_run.ipynb and medred_reflexion_run.ipynb contain the final set up that we use to run our experiments in the report
* pubmed_adversarial_setup_Shuwei.ipynb contains the final set up for adversarial training
* Inside medredqa and pubmedqa folders, we also uploaded the results of our runs, including the question, reflexion process and final answer by the LLM
